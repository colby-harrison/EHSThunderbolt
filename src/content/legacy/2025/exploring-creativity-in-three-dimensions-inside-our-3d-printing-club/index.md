Have you ever imagined designing and creating your own objects from scratch? At East High School, the 3D Printing Club is turning these dreams into reality! This innovative group of students is diving into the exciting world of design, technology, and creativity, making everything from practical tools to artistic creations.

What Is the 3D Printing Club? The 3D Printing Club is a place where students collaborate, experiment, and learn how to bring their ideas to life using advanced technology. Club members use computer-aided design (CAD) software to craft models, which are then transformed into physical objects with the help of 3D printers.

"Our goal is to combine creativity and technical skills," says Brydon, the club president. "It's amazing to see an idea go from a sketch on paper to a physical object you can hold in your hand."

Projects That Inspire The club works on a variety of projects, ranging from personal items like keychains and phone holders to more ambitious endeavors like robot components and prosthetic parts. Recently, the group designed a set of custom chess pieces for the school library, showcasing both creativity and precision.

Learning Through Collaboration No prior experience? No problem! The 3D Printing Club welcomes beginners and provides hands-on guidance. Members help each other troubleshoot designs, operate the printers, and refine their skills in CAD software.

"One of the best parts of the club is how supportive everyone is," says Mikah , a freshman. "You don't need to be an expert to join. Everyone learns together."

Why Join the Club? Joining the 3D Printing Club is not just about making cool stuff—it’s also a chance to develop valuable skills that can lead to careers in engineering, design, or technology. Plus, it’s a fun way to meet like-minded peers and bring your creative visions to life.

The club meets every Wednesday at 3-4 in room 508. Whether you're interested in technology, design, or just want to try something new, the 3D Printing Club has a place for you.

Get Involved! If you're ready to take your creativity to the next level, stop by one of the meetings or contact Bryden  for more information. Come with ideas, and leave with skills—and maybe even your next masterpiece!
