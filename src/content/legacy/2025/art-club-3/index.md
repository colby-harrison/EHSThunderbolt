The Art Club has been busy this season with exciting activities and successful events. Here’s what’s happening:

- **No Meeting This Week**: There will be no Art Club meeting on Tuesday, November 26, as we gear up for Thanksgiving break. Regular meetings will resume on Tuesday, December 10.
- **December 3 Field Trip**: Art Club members are eagerly looking forward to an all-day field trip on December 3. We’ll explore the Denver Art Museum and the Longmont Museum, immersing ourselves in creative inspiration and culture. If you want to go, be sure to turn in your permission slips so Mrs. Pearson knows how many are going and can plan accordingly.
- **Craft Fair Success**: The recent collaboration with CTE for the craft fair was a fantastic success! Art Club members sold an impressive number of handmade earrings and ornaments, showcasing their artistic talents and raising funds for future projects.

Stay tuned for more updates and be sure to join us when meetings resume in December. Until then, have a wonderful Thanksgiving break!
