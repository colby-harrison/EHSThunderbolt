CHEYENNE, Wyo. – The Cheyenne East Girls Basketball team proved their dominance throughout the season, heading into the 4A Girls Basketball State Championship Tournament as one of the top teams in Wyoming. After securing the 4A East Regional Championship, the Lady Thunderbirds looked to continue their success in Casper.

At regionals, East showcased their fast-paced, defensive-minded play. They opened with a commanding **65-22** win over Cheyenne South, then battled past Sheridan **50-42** in the semifinals. In the championship game, the Thunderbirds delivered a statement victory, defeating Cheyenne Central **55-41** to claim the No. 1 seed heading into state.

Once in Casper, East faced fierce competition. They opened the tournament with a strong defensive showing, defeating Kelly Walsh **36-20** in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Thunderbirds went to overtime against Sheridan but fell just short, losing **47-43**. Despite the tough loss, East had a chance to finish their season with a podium finish.

In the third-place game, East took on Campbell County in another hard-fought battle. Despite a strong effort, they came up short, falling **53-48**. The Lady Thunderbirds finished fourth at state, capping off an incredible season built on defense, speed, and teamwork.

"We needed our ability to be us, that was really huge for us this year," East Head Coach Eric Westling said. "When we got out of it, it was usually a part of our own psyche, and we just needed to trust and believe in each other. I think we did a really good job of that."

While the season didn't end with a championship, the Lady Thunderbirds cemented themselves as one of Wyoming’s elite teams, and their deep tournament run showcased the resilience and talent that defined their year.
