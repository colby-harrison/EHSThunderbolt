CHEYENNE, Wyo. — East High School senior wrestler Liam Fox had an undefeated championship week, showcasing his skills as a 150-pound competitor.

Fox's first win came during a dual against Laramie. He followed it with four victories at the Top of the Rockies Tournament in Lafayette, Colorado, including one by medical forfeit.

“I just went in with the mentality that I was going to wrestle my hardest and not let anyone stop me,” Fox said. “I had tough matches, faced strong competitors, and even wrestled a longtime friend. I’m just glad I got the job done.”

Of the matches on the mat, Fox won three by technical fall. He secured the championship with a 9-3 decision.

Fox’s strong season start positions him as a key point scorer for the Thunderbirds.

“Getting a big win hypes up the team,” Fox shared. “It motivates us to keep pushing forward and keeps the energy alive.”
