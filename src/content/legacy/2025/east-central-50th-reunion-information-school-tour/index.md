Attention East High alumni! The East/Central 50th Reunion is coming up, and we want to make sure all classmates can find the information they need. We’ve attached links to **Visit Cheyenne** and the official **East/Central 50th Reunion Information** to help you plan for the event.

As part of the reunion festivities, a **school tour of East High** is scheduled for **August 2nd**, and a few classmates have already signed up. If you or someone you know is interested in attending, be sure to check out the details and spread the word!

For any questions or additional information, feel free to reach out. We look forward to welcoming alumni back to East High!
