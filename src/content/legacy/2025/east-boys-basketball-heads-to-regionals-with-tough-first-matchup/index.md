The Cheyenne East boys' basketball team is gearing up for a tough regional tournament, and the best part? They're playing in their hometown! East will take on Thunder Basin in the first round on March 6 at 1:30 p.m., and they need their fans to show out and bring the energy.

This tournament is crucial, as only the top four teams will qualify for the state championship. If East defeats Thunder Basin, they will face the number-one-seeded Campbell County, adding another layer of difficulty to their path forward. However, the Thunderbirds are determined to prove themselves and secure a spot at state.

With their season on the line, East will need to lock in, play with intensity, and work together to overcome the competition. The team has shown resilience all season, and now it’s time to bring everything they have to the court. Fans can support them as they take on Thunder Basin in what promises to be a high-energy battle.

Now is the time to rally behind our team. Pack the stands, bring the noise, and let’s help East punch their ticket to state!
