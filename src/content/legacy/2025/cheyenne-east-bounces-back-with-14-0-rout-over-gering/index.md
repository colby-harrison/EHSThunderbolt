After a tough start to their season, the Cheyenne East Thunderbirds responded in a big way.

Opening the season on the road, East faced a strong Scottsbluff team and fell 5-1. The Bearcats, remembering their loss to East in March of 2024, returned the favor with a decisive win, handing the Thunderbirds an early wake-up call.

But East didn’t dwell on the loss for long.

Just days later, the Thunderbirds hit the road again to face Gering and came away with a massive 14-0 victory. The offense clicked from the opening whistle, and East poured on the goals in a relentless performance that showcased their ability to bounce back and regroup quickly.

The dominating win is an early statement for East, proving they’re more than capable of shaking off setbacks and staying competitive in a tough schedule. The Thunderbirds now look to build on the momentum as conference play heats up.

Meanwhile, Scottsbluff also returned to action on April 22, but their fortunes reversed as they fell 4-1 to Central, showing just how unpredictable and competitive early-season matchups can be.

As teams begin to find their rhythm, Cheyenne East is already showing signs of resilience—and they’re just getting started.
