Cheyenne East senior Connor Kling made a major decision about his future on Monday when he signed with Laramie County Community College (LCCC) to continue his soccer career. The commitment allows Kling to stay close to his family while pursuing his passion for soccer and studying kinesiology.

Kling, a versatile player who has excelled in various roles for the Thunderbirds, played primarily as a defender and midfielder during his senior season. He also showcased his offensive skills as a forward in his sophomore year. His dynamic play earned him first-team All-East Conference honors last season after scoring four goals and recording seven assists.

Kling’s experience with the 307 Select club team has exposed him to diverse playing styles across the country, and he believes his versatility is one of his greatest strengths. “We’ve played all around the country, which has exposed me to a lot of styles of play,” Kling said.

East coach Alex Stratton praised Kling’s competitive nature and drive for excellence. “He hates to lose, and he’s by far the most electric player we have,” Stratton said. “He’s the kind of kid who’ll be disappointed if he misses a shot, but then will score a miraculous goal from 40 yards out.”

In addition to his athletic talents, Kling plans to study kinesiology at LCCC, with hopes of becoming an athletic trainer. "If coaching doesn’t work for me, being an athletic trainer will keep me around sports," he said. With his strong ties to family and his passion for soccer and academics, Kling is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
