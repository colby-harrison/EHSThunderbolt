This spell creates and launches 4 Meteor to selected spots which each have a radius of 40ft. These each deal 20d6 fire and 20d6 bludgeoning damage. If hit by more than one meteor the creature or non-magical object that is not held or worn take only one radius of damage each and if the object is flammable it catches fire. Creatures resistant to fire still take an average of 105 damage from one orb. So explore and fight on in you amazing adventures.
