This is a spell that is both defensive and offensive. “You can’t get much more fortified than the level nine spell prismatic wall.”(CBR.com) It creates a colorful wall of light up to 90 feet long and 30 feet high and seven colored light layers thick. It can also become a sphere 30 feet in diameter. It’s is so bright that it can blind creators within 20 feet away when they fail a con saving throw. The castor and their allies can just walk through it but their enemy’s are not as lucky. Every layer has its own effect that deals up to 10d6 damage of that respective effect and it restrains or blinds the invader at each layer when they failed dex save.
