Spring Break is almost here, but before juniors can enjoy their time off, there's one big event coming up – the ACT test at 7:20 AM! 🌅

On ACT test day, juniors must arrive on time. If they are late, they will not be allowed to enter and will need to speak with their counselor about rescheduling. So set those alarms early! ⏰📚

Meanwhile, all other grade levels are excused from coming to school and should not show up. Instead, they will participate in virtual day activities provided by the counselor. 🎧💻

Once testing is over, everyone can look forward to Spring Break and enjoy a well-deserved break! 🌴☀️🎉
