Cheyenne East and Cheyenne Central battled in a heated cross-town rivalry matchup. In a game filled with momentum swings and intense competition, the Thunderbirds emerged victorious, defeating the Indians 58-51 in front of a packed crowd.

From the opening tip, both teams showcased their physicality and determination. Central came out strong, hitting early shots and playing aggressive defense, but East quickly responded with a dominant inside presence and key lay ups and free throws to keep the game close.
