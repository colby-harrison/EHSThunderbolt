There are many powerful spells in DnD that make your story eventful and fun and the spell Wish is arguably the most powerful one. This is a 9th level spell and it can bestow just about any wish that the dm approves. There are other effects that might backfire the spell such as asking for immortality could be twisted and just have you turn into a stone. There are uses like reviving the dead and others as stated in the players hand book. The spell will require xp and other costs when you use a duplicated or upgraded spell that was made from this spell. The castor can use it multiple changes but the amount of times it can be cast is decided by the dm. Thus the spell wish could be used to make any or all players overpower and it adds a fun unique twist to the story.
