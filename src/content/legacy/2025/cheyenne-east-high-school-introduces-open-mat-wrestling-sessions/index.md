Cheyenne East High School has launched Open Mat wrestling sessions, offering students a valuable opportunity to enhance their skills ahead of the competitive season. These sessions are held every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 6:15 to 7:15 a.m., starting October 8th, in the school's wrestling room.

Open Mat sessions provide a flexible, self-directed environment where wrestlers of all experience levels can focus on technique, conditioning, and drills. While coaches are available for guidance, the format encourages individual initiative, allowing participants to target specific areas for improvement. This initiative is open to all East High students interested in wrestling, whether they are current team members or newcomers to the sport. It's an excellent way for aspiring wrestlers to gain insight into the sport and prepare for the upcoming season.
