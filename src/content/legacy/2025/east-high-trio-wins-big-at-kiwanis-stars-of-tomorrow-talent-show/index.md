The Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne hosted the 71st Annual Stars of Tomorrow Talent Show on Sunday, March 9th at the Surbrugg/Prentice Auditorium at Laramie County Community College. It provides young performers from Laramie County with an opportunity to showcase their talents in many categories, including dance, music, and other performing arts. Participants range from kindergarten through 12th grade. Four members of East High School took part in the show with Addison Fairweather doing an Irish Step Dance and Raine Brekhus, Vincent Gallizzi and Loriana Walter preforming a jazz vocal trio. The trio had amazing results, winning the High School Division. They then went on to win Best in Show. This is Loriana’s second time winning best in show. “This was my 12th year being a part of the program. I won the elementary division in 2019 and the junior high division as well as best in show in 2021, but there is something about winning it my senior year that makes it so special.” says Loriana Walter, 12. For winning the high school division, the group received $750 that goes towards the arts program at the school. There was an additional $750 for winning best in show. “We had already talked about what we were going to do with the money if we won,” say Raine Brekhus, 12, “Our sound system is nearing the end of its life, and it will be a nice gift for us to leave behind.” The Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne’s Stars of Tomorrow Talent Show continues to be a wonderful tradition, providing a space for young artists to shine while supporting the arts in the community.
