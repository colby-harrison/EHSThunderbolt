In Wyoming, the season of spring doesn't always make itself apparent. While other states are experiencing warmer temperatures, Wyoming residents are still scraping frost off their cars and shoveling snow. Some students at East High School have mixed feelings about our state’s weather. “I don’t enjoy Wyoming winters because of the wind and how dead everything looks. I would rather live in Oregon because I love the weather there and how it has beach and forests.” Says Kylie Demelas, 10. Although the cold isn’t for everyone, there are definitely those who enjoy Wyoming weather.

As we get further into the winter months, a back and forth between sunny days and snowstorms is constantly tormenting students. One day it’s 60 degrees and sunny, the next there’s inches of snow and wild winds. There have been a few times this school year where students and even staff have been expecting a snow day or virtual day, and there has yet to be one. “I think that they shouldn’t do virtual days and only give us snow days where we get the day off.” Says Logan Capps, 10. “I think we definitely should've gotten a few snow days so far this year.” Along with the argument of when snow days should occur, some students also lecture that the inclusion of “virtual days” should not be an option. Either way, I think most would agree that sow days offer a nice break for students and staff.
