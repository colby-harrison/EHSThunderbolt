At East High School, like many other schools across the United States, the number of students using AI is continuously growing. Studies show that about 86% of students in the U.S. use AI to complete their work or study. While AI can be a useful and unique tool for learning, its overuse— especially when students rely on it to do their work for them— can have a lot of consequences. Students may not realize that using AI in this way limits their ability to learn and encourages them to depend on technology. Depending on technology can negatively impact their time management skills. With AI allowing students to complete assignments quickly and effortlessly, they may struggle with work ethics and meeting deadlines in real-world scenarios where these tools are unavailable. Eventually, this could affect their ability to perform effectively in professional settings.

AI may get your work done quickly, but many students still end up with poor grades like C's and D's. AI does not have the ability to understand what you're currently learning in your classrooms, leading it to do its own thing and not do your work in the correct way. Many teachers can easily tell the difference between AI-generated work and a student's work. Relying on AI often results in work that lacks the depth and understanding that teachers look for. Many platforms that you turn your work into— like Canvas— have AI detectors so your teachers can know right away that you used AI to complete your work, leading to a failing grade.

AI may sometimes be a great resource to use but using it all the time will negatively impact you. Learning the subject and using the resources East High provides for you will not only help you now, but also in the future.
