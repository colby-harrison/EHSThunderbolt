The Cheyenne East girls' wrestling team captured the regional championship with an impressive performance at the East Regional tournament. Freshman Abigail Clay led the charge, pinning Torrington’s Cathryn Reimer in just 20 seconds to claim the 235-pound title. Despite competing in a smaller bracket, Clay remained confident in her state qualification.

East finished with a dominant 193 points, outpacing Sheridan’s 152. Several wrestlers also placed as runners-up, highlighting the team’s depth and competitiveness. Burns-Pine Bluffs finished 12th with 49 points in the 25-team field.

While East celebrated their victory, some wrestlers faced tough matchups, showing that additional training and experience could enhance their performance at state. Clay’s smaller bracket also raised discussions about the level of competition.

With momentum on their side, East is now preparing for the state tournament, where they will face a wider field of opponents. Additional practice and strategy adjustments will be key to maintaining their edge.

Cheyenne East’s regional title cements them as top contenders, but refining their skills and focus will be crucial as they push toward state championship success.
