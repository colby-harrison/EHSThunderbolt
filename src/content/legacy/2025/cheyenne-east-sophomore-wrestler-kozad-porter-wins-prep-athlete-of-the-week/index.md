Porter went 5-0 with two pins and a technical fall on Saturday to win the 132-pound bracket at the 67th Rocky Welton Invitational in Garden City, Kansas. Those efforts earned him Prep Athlete of the Week honors from WyoSports’ Cheyenne staff.

Porter described winning the Welton title as a bit of redemption for his showing at Top of the Rockies.

“Being able to win a tournament like that is really eye-opening, especially after not doing well at Top of the Rockies,” Porter said. “It felt really good to go win a tough tournament like that.”

East coach Thad Trujillo isn’t surprised to hear Porter say he was disappointed in his performance at Top of the Rockies because Porter is his own worst critic.
