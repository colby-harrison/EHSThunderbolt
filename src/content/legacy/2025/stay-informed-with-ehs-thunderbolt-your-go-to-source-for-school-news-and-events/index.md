Cheyenne East High School students now have a new and improved way to stay informed about everything happening at school — the EHS Thunderbolt article page. Created with students in mind, the Thunderbolt is an online space dedicated to sharing important updates, event information, and key dates in a way that’s easy to access, easy to read, and always available when you need it.

The EHS Thunderbolt is like TBTV with a better way of getting information — instead of just watching the broadcast, students can now read about the latest events and announcements. This allows students to get a better understanding of what’s going on because there’s more space for details, reminders, and even last-minute changes that might not make it into a weekly broadcast.

From school dances, sports schedules, and club meetings to academic deadlines, testing dates, and community events, the Thunderbolt keeps it all in one place. No more scrambling to remember what was said during announcements or worrying about missing something important. With just a few clicks, students, staff, and even parents can stay caught up.

The goal of the EHS Thunderbolt is to make information easy to find and accessible for everyone. It’s updated regularly, so students always know what’s coming up and can plan ahead — whether it’s for a big game, a college application deadline, or a fun school spirit event.

The EHS Thunderbolt is more than just another school website — it’s your personal guide to staying organized and involved at East. Don’t miss out — check it often and stay connected with everything happening at Cheyenne East High School.
