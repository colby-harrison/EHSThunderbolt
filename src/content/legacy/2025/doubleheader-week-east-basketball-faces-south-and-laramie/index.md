East High basketball is gearing up for a exciting week ahead, with back-to-back doubleheaders against fierce rivals South and Laramie. This stretch of games will be a true test for both the boys’ and girls’ teams as they push through the heart of conference play.

The action starts on Wednesday, January 29, when the Thunderbirds take on cross-town rival South High. The games will be split between two locations, with Storey Gym and South hosting the Sophomore and JV matchups at 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM, respectively. The varsity girls will take the court at 6:00 PM, followed by the boys at 7:30 PM. With local bragging rights on the line, expect an intense battle in every matchup.

After a short turnaround, East will face another major challenge on Friday, January 31, when they host longtime rival Laramie in the Thunder Dome. The energy will be electric as the T-Birds defend their home court against a tough Plainsmen squad. Game times remain the same as Wednesday, with the sophomores at 3:00 PM, JV at 4:30 PM, varsity girls at 6:00 PM, and the boys closing out the night at 7:30 PM.

These games are crucial as the regular season heats up, and fan support can make all the difference. Students, parents, and the entire East High community are encouraged to pack the stands, wear their East colors, and bring the energy to help fuel the teams. Whether it's at Storey Gym, South, or the Thunder Dome, let’s make some noise and show why East has the best student section in the state!
