The winter season offers more than just unique activities, fun holidays, and opportunities to enjoy the snow. It also offers us the opportunity to express ourselves through our attire in ways that would be unbearable in the summer heat. Students were able to showcase their winter fashion which has a wide variety of tastes. Ranging from focusing on cozy comfort to smooth and stylish, we saw a variety of winter styles in the hallway.

When it comes to stylish, it was, as Shrek might say, all about the layers. Layer 1: This is your secret weapon. It's the boring, but essential part, think of this as they base layer to the cake you can't see it but it's the foundation. Layer 2: Now we add some flavor! A stylish sweater or a cute shirt like a layer of whipped cream. It's where you can show off your personality and add some color. Layer 3: This is the star of the show! Your awesome coat - the butter cream frosting. It keeps you warm and makes a statement. The accessories (aka the Sprinkles): Scarves are like colorful sprinkles, and the hats are the cherries on top. It doesn't have to be all about style in the winter; sometimes students just preferred to dress for comfort and a more casual vibe. Sweaters, sweats, beanies, and a good coffee was the look for some this winter.

Whether it was chic and stylish or cozy and casual, East students made the most of the opportunities to embrace wintertime fashion trends.
