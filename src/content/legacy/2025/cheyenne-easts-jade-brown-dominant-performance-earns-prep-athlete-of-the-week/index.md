Cheyenne East forward **Jade Brown** delivered a standout performance this past weekend, averaging **14 points, 8.5 rebounds, and four blocks** to lead the Thunderbirds to a 2-0 record. Her efforts earned her **Prep Athlete of the Week** honors from W Sports' Cheyenne staff.

While Brown’s offensive contributions were key, her biggest impact came on defense, where she successfully guarded two of Class 4A’s top scorers. “She’s just locking in defensively,” East’s coaching staff said. “It’s impressive to watch.”

With East adjusting to the loss of a key player this season, Brown and her teammates have stepped up. “We’re pushing each other in practice, and it’s paying off,” Brown said.

As the season winds down, Brown’s leadership on both ends of the floor will be crucial for East’s playoff push.
