The Spell Harm releases a virulent disease on its target. The target then takes a con save and when failed the creature take 14D6 necrotic damage. The only saving trait is the target canâ€™t fall below 1 hit point. This is not always better though because their max hit points fall by the amount of damage they take over the hour so if they heal they will lose more hit points which could make their max Hp drop even lower than when they first took damage. Also the illness is one where you would rather watch it kill them and not make them suffer in the way they would as describe by the players handbook.
