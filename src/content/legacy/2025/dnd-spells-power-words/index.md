Power words such as Power Word Kill and Power Word Stun are arguably the most powerful spells in DnD on Par with wish. The non-lethal Power Word Stun is instant and it stuns any one target within sight with the caster saying one word. Though the target has to be below 100 hit points and to fail the save. The lethal version is the exact same except the fact that the target would just drop dead they would not fall unconscious as on normally would when the fall to 0 hit points. If the spell fails the castor still loses their spell slot and nothing would have happened
