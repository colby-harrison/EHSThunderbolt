After falling to Central High School in their last matchup, the East High School Thunderbirds made sure history didn’t repeat itself. On Wednesday night, they delivered a strong performance, taking down the Central Indians with a 58-51 victory. The win not only avenged their previous loss but also ended a four-game road slump, improving East’s record to 7-7 for the season.

The Thunderbirds had struggled in recent away games, dropping contests against Campbell County, Sheridan, and Central before finally turning things around. However, their home performances showed promise with victories over Rock Springs and Natrona County earlier in the month. Meanwhile, Central has been navigating a tough stretch, losing seven of their last eight games and now sitting at 5-9.

With this victory, East reestablished itself as a team to watch, proving they can rise to the occasion when it matters most. As the season progresses, the Thunderbirds will aim to build on this momentum, while Central looks to regroup and find a way to bounce back.
