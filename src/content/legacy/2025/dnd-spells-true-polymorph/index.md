This spell allows you to change any creature beast or even undead into any other creature of the same challenge rating or lower and that even includes yourself. This allows new types of damage and even high damaging forms of other creatures. It does have limits tough such as it has a certain cooldown and it can end when the creature with the spell applied to that creature drops down to 0hp but otherwise its up to you and your imagination to explore and punch the limits of.
