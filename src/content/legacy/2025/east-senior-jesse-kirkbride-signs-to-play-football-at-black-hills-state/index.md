East High senior guard Jesse Kirkbride has achieved his dream of playing college football, signing with Black Hills State University in Spearfish, South Dakota, for the upcoming season.

“This means a lot to me because it brings me and my future teammates together,” Kirkbride said. “All my hard work to get here is done. I’m going to college, so it lifts a huge weight off my shoulders.”

Kirkbride, who also considered Chadron State and Dickinson State, made his decision after receiving an invite to visit Black Hills State. “I just liked the culture there. The community supports everyone, and it felt like the right place for me,” he said.

A key player for East’s offensive line, Kirkbride helped lead the T-Birds to their third consecutive state championship game appearance and the No. 1 rushing offense in the state. His standout moment came during a playoff victory over Campbell County, where East stopped a two-point conversion with less than a minute remaining.

East coach Chad Goff praised Kirkbride’s football IQ. “He was truly our second quarterback out there. He had a great mind for the game,” Goff said.

Kirkbride plans to study exercise science at Black Hills State and aspires to become a coach. His commitment to football and education marks a bright future ahead.
