A crazy remake of the classic 90’s _IT_ premiered in theatres on September 8. After the release, the Thunderbolt staff hit the halls and asked over 50 students and teachers to see which version was better: 1990 _IT_ or 2017 _IT_. Over half of the students that were interviewed said they liked the new one better because it had improved in graphics and effects. The new one also was scarier than the first one. The students that liked the 1990 version more they said that they didn’t like the sexual content.
