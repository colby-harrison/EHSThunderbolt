In the year of 2015, President Donald Trump’s federal judge nominee, Jeff Mateer made a speech titled ‘The Church and Homosexuality.” Claims he made throughout the speech have received a mix of criticism and praise.

A few of the claims Mateer made include; transgender children are part of Satan’s plan, the Supreme Court’s decision to allow same-sex marriage will lead to “disgusting” new versions of wedlock, and conversion therapy or bible based counseling being outlawed is allowing “the gays” to invade.

The first and arguably biggest issue that caught the attention of the public media was the remark on transgender children. In his speech Mateer discussed a lawsuit in Colorado where parents sued their child’s school because they prevented her from using the bathroom of her choice.

“Now I submit to you, a parent of three children who are now young adults, a first grader really knows their sexual identity?” Jeff said. “I mean it really shows you how Satan’s plan is working and the destruction that is going on.”

These remarks caught the attention of many LGBTQ+ advocates including Chad Griffin who tweeted, “This is horrific. Someone who attacks children in this way has no place on the federal or public bench.”

Mateer also commented on the Supreme Court decision to allow same-sex marriage could lead to “disgusting” new forms of matrimony.” “I submit to you that there’ll be no line there. And actually in the arguments Chief Justice Roberts, who’s in the center there said, I mean, what is the limiting?” Mateer stated. He continues on and compares the idea of polyamorous relationships to movie ratings. “And I’ll tell you, we say it’s PG-13, it may be R.”

Lastly, he argues that conversion therapy should be considered a safe and good way of counseling.  He then goes on to say that when a state bans that or anything similar to biblical counseling, the state is inviting “the gays” in. This particular notion of Mateer’s has hardly been commented on openly, however, people such as Vice President Mike Pence has been heavily associated with conversion therapy.

When all is said and done, Mateer has yet to be confirmed by the House of Senates, however having an agreement in opinion with the Vice President may help Mateer secure his conformation despite his seemingly radical beliefs. His conformations could potentially call to question the meaning of the separation of Church and State and what is considered radical and moderate. With the case of Jeff Mateer, he easily blurs the lines of both and continues making remarks on the imminent threat of the ‘invading gays’.
