October 22 2017, 10 nights before Halloween. I went to a haunted house downtown. When I turned that corner I thought to myself what did I get myself into? Once I started to walk clowns and more clowns were beginning to pop out, I was frightened. Through the entire haunted house, I screamed my head off. It was longer than I thought it would be. When we were finishing the haunted house I could barely talk my throat felt scratchy. After what happened that night I got scared of every little sound I heard. After that haunted house, IÂ  don't want to ever go to one again.
