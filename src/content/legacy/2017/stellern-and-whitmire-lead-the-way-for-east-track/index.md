East High’s Cosette Stellern has been one of the more dominating athletes in Cheyenne. She has helped the Lady Thunderbirds win multiple state titles in volleyball and basketball and has spent the last four years as one of the top female shot put and discus competitors in the state. This year the University of Wyoming-bound senior is still out in front of her competition.

Stellern started the season off by taking the crown at the Okie Blanchard Invitational on April 7 with a throw of 41 feet, 5 inches in the shot and 119 feet, 5 inches in the discus. Her girls’ team won the meet with a final score of 138 points.

Other East athletes that won championships at the Okie Invite were: Justus Whitmire, who won the 100M (11.53) and the 400M (50.83); the girls’ 4x100 team (51.63); the boys’ 4x100 (43.40); Marina Howard, who won the high jump (5-03); and, Lily Joslin, who won both the pole vault (10-09) and the triple jump (33-10).

Cosette then brought home her second shot put championship of the outdoor season, when she won the Burns Invite, on April 15, with a throw of 40 feet, 6 inches.

Cosette really stepped up on April 19, winning both the discus and the shot at the Laramie County Throwers’ Invitational. Stellern, a left-hander, had been waiting all spring for a wind that blew from left to right, and she got her wish, hitting 139-3 in the discus. Her previous best mark this season was 126-8.

“The wind is so important with the discus,” she said in an interview with wyosports.net. “If you get it flat and you get it in the wind, the wind will just take it and carry it.”

She won shot put at 39 feet, 8 inches. Senior Jadyn Kanzler was second (38-1) and Sierra Stellern took third with a throw of 36 feet, 9½ inches.

Cosette Stellern continued her winning ways, taking both the shot put and discus at the Thunderbirds’ throwers dual with Cheyenne South on April 26, with a top throw of 40 feet, 3 inches and discus final measurement of 141-1. Jadyn Kanzler was second in shot (36-1) and Sierra Stellern took second in discus (107-5). Sierra Stellern was third in shot at 35 feet, 3 inches. East senior Mitchell Bell won the boys’ discus with a throw of 133 feet, 2 inches, and took second in shot (46-7) at the dual.

One of the better events the T-Birds attend each year is the LoboCat Invitation in Colorado. This year’s meet was held on April 28. Justus Whitmire again paced the team, taking a championship in the 100M (11.37). The boys’ 4x100 relay team, consisting of Kyler Freeman, Pete Mead, Dakota Merritt and Justus Whitmire, also grabbed a big win, finsihing in 44.21 seconds.

The team is scheduled to compete in Torrington on May 5, at Regionals in Gillette on May 13, and at the State Meet in Casper on May 20.
