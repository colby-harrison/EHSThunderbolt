Spring break is easily one of the most anticipated weeks. Not only does it mean that school is almost over, but it’s finally warm enough for kids to get out and enjoy themselves. Each year we hear stories of all of the cool things that kids did over spring break. Some of your fellow peers traveled to faraway places, but others just stayed home and enjoyed their days off.

One of the easiest vacations is by embracing the weather up in Curt Gowdy state park for a little camping and hiking.

“I went with my friends to Curt Gowdy,” said junior Brittany West. “It was fun, we all went hiking and we caught crawdads.”

Senior Samantha Jurkowski spent the time with her family and her foreign exchange student Léa Paidoussis in Moab, Utah.

“We hiked a lot while we were there,” said Jurkowski. “One day we hiked about 14 or 15 miles and we climbed up all of the arches that were there.”

Many of us dream of relaxing on a beach and soaking up some sun. Senior Camille Roberts took a trip to Mexico to enjoy some warm weather.

“It was fun, we spent a lot of time hanging out at the beach,” said Roberts. “We also went snorkeling while we were there.”

Senor Braden Morris spent his spring break traveling several hours to Phoenix, Arizona, to play baseball with his Post 6 baseball team.

“We left Saturday at 6:00 am and traveled all day,” said Morris. “We played four games, and then we went and watched a spring training game.”

Senior Alissa Gonzales spent her time enjoying her break from school by just staying close to home.

“I spent most of my time working and making cash money flow,” said Gonzales. “I also went and hung out in Colorado, which was fun. If I could have gone anywhere, I would’ve gone to somewhere warm like Hawaii, Mexico or the Bahamas. ”

Senior Alexis Neckermann also spent her time close to home working and enjoying some time off.

“I dog sat and house sat for my spring break,” said Neckermann. “If I could have gone anywhere, I would’ve gone to Missouri to see my family and go fishing at the lake.”

Most times the stories we hear about are the cool trips. While those are always fun as seen by some of the students, it is still possible to enjoy your spring break close to home with some friends and family like Alissa and Alexis did.
