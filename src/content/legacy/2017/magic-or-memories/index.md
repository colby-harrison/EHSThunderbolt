Being high school students born from 1998-2003, we are the generation that was born into Disney movies- Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Lion King, Finding Nemo- we grew up watching them every day. We knew the songs, loved the characters, and watched the movies any chance we got. Now that we have entered our teen years, we would expect to not still be constantly surrounded by all things Disney.

However, Disney has announced over 16 remakes or sequels to be released within the upcoming years. It began in 2015, with the live-action remake of Cinderella, originally released in 1950. Then they released Finding Dory in 2016, the sequel to Finding Nemo, released in 2003. Recently they have released a live-action remake for Beauty and the Beast, originally released in 1991, then again in 2017.

Beginning their ascent into what can only be entitled “The Remake Years,” Disney has been both disappointing, and exciting their fans with the prospects of these “new” movies.

“I feel like it’s going to let me relive all of the things I had when I was really little, and I think that’s awesome,” said freshman Garth Shaw.

While some students choose to celebrate these remakes and sequels, others are not so fond of the idea.

“They’re classic movies for a reason, and they should stay classic movies instead of trying to up it,” said senior Samantha Jurkowski.

Many students didn’t even realize how many movies were being remade by Disney.

“I did not know that,” said Shaw. “That is crazy! That’ll be awesome.”

Disney plans to continue the remaking trend, by continuing on with a live action Mulan, Dumbo, and Winnie the Pooh, along with sequels to classics such as Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, and another Pirates of the Caribbean.

Many students look forward to catching these movies in theaters sometime soon, and think that what Disney is onto something great by remaking the classics.

“The originals were really good. They worked so well the first time, so Disney hopes they’ll work well again,” said junior Parris Kline. “A lot of kids our age seem to already be enjoying them.”

Many believe that the new movies may even be an improvement.

“They’re bringing the new times into the old classics,” said sophomore McKenzie Dean.

Others believe that Disney has run out of better ideas.

“They know they’re good, and they’re going to get viewership,” said senior Charlotte Hecht. “They don’t need to come up with new movie ideas.”

Some even think Disney is all in it for the money.

“All the older people, people like me, they are going to go back and spend money on it,” said Shaw.

Either way, Disney plans to release at least 16 movies within the next 3 years, most of which are remakes or sequels. Be prepared for the Disney logo to be popping up in a theater near you.
