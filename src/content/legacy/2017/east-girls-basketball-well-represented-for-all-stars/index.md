Each year a select group of players travel north to compete against Montana’s best male and female high school basketball players. This year the 4A state champion East High Lady Thunderbirds will be well-represented in the annual event.

Guards Jessie Erickson and Katie Loken will be joined on the Wyoming all-star team by forwards Cosette and Sierra Stellern. Cheyenne Central guard Abby Fearneyhough is the only other Cheyenne representative.

The series starts Friday, June 9, at Sheridan College. The second game will be played Saturday, June 10, in Billings, Montana. The girls’ game starts at 5:30 p.m. both nights, followed by the boys’ game.
