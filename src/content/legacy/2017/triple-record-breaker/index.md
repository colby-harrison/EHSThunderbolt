Mackenzie Marler ran the big 5k for cross country and broke the record for the third time at the 40th Annual Liberty Bell Invite in Littleton, Colorado on September 8. Marler broke the 5k record for the third time with a time of 17.59 minutes on September 1, beating her previous time of 18.34 minutes. 88 schools from Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nebraska attended the Liberty Bell Invite. A lot of practice and preparation went into improving her time. Marler stated that she prepared for the season over the summer. “I just ran a lot this summer and did a lot of work outs”, she soon hopes to make a new personal record.
