Imagine over 1,000 voices chanting the same inspiring words.

Imagine over 1,000 people from different lives moving in unity for the same reasons.

Imagine equality for everyone in the Equality State.

On January 21st that dream started to become reality.

In Cheyenne, a community-wide march happened that exemplified the unity of the region. Almost all people at the event brought either signs with catchy slogans and clever salutations to the new president, or wore fancy head coverings (the signature pink cat hats included) to show their support.

As everyone slowly gathered and met in front of the depot downtown, anticipation built for the people to be able to join together in protest of the threats of limiting women’s rights and increasing the equality for all people.

The entire way up to the Capitol building and back to the depot, the crowd chanted and sang phrases that were easily learned, like “women’s rights are human rights”, “we matter, we vote”, and the typical call and respond chant “show me what democracy looks like- this is what democracy looks like!”

As you may have heard, Donald Trump has been inaugurated as President of the United States. As soon as this news spread worldwide, communities everwhere came together to express their concerns for human rights, especially those of women. Concerns about women’s rights have become a rally cry because Trump has been accused of being a misogynist and giving women unfair treatment in comparison to men because he has openly supported the pro-life movement and the idea that women are sexual objects. Women themselves and male feminists have taken these issues and more to heart recently because of the fear that this anti-feminist would limit their rights and affect their lives personally.

At the other end of the march, a variety of speakers vocalized their opinions and personal experience that related to the issue at hand. Wyoming House Minority Floor Leader Cathy Connolly told the crowd that when she came to Wyoming 20 years ago, she was excited to start a new life, but several things needed to change. One of the main things that she wanted to strive for was to close the wage gap between men and women.

Native American poet Darrah Perez also spoke, reading a poem she wrote that is included in one of her books. She mentioned things like moving onto bigger things than the patriarchy and the fact that women should be able say what they mean and want for themselves. Her poem covered these topics and brought it into more of a personal perspective.

Music was also shared by Marcie Smith, who led the entire crowd in singing “Singing for our Lives”, which has lyrics such as “We are a gentle angry people, and we are singing for our lives,” and “We are young and old together, and we are singing for our lives.”

The marchers then marched back to the depot plaza where more speakers shared their thoughts on women’s rights and brought up other applicable and current issues, like the rights of Muslim people.

Many of the participants plan to continue their cry for change, meaning there will probably be a rise in the number of marches and people standing up for their beliefs and rights throughout the country and the world because of the controversial spirit that Trump has put in the air. This increase in action is already visible in the participation of people locally, but also within social media and in the way people have come together to react to the inauguration and the effects of it.

The hope for all of this action, if nothing else happens, is to make everyone aware of the world around them.
