Standing at the top of the podium has become a habit for East High senior Blake Danni. This past September, he managed to bring home a 4A state golf championship for the second year in a row.

Playing in front of his hometown fans, Danni posted a 66 and 74 to finish with a 140-stroke total, four strokes ahead of Kelly Walsh’s Logan Hensley. Danni’s teammate, Michael Pope, finished in 4th place with a 149. The team finished in 2nd place with a 610 total, six strokes behind Kelly Walsh.

In 2017, Danni won the individual title at the Class 4A state golf tournament in Evanston. He was the first Thunderbird to take the individual title in East’s 57-year history.

Danni knocked off Sheridan’s Kirby Coe-Kirkham by a single stroke. East took second place as a team in 2017, losing to Kelly Walsh in a sudden death playoff.
