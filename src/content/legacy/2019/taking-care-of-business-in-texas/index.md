In late June, the East High chapter of Future Business Leaders of America headed to the national FBLA convention in San Antonio, Texas. FBLA is recognized as the largest business student organization in the world, and student chapter representatives made appearances from across the globe. FBLA has 230,000 members and 5,200 chapters, all meeting once a year to meet and compete against each other. 

Cheyenne East High’s chapter had the opportunity to bring ten students, competing in business events including spreadsheet application, personal finance, emerging business issues and electronic portfolio.   

The Thunderbirds, as well as the rest of the chapters from across Wyoming and the world, spent the week nervously waiting for results of hundreds of events, touring the famous River Walk, visiting the Alamo, enjoying some down time at a Missions baseball game, and networking with other chapters.  

Senior Dylan Raymond went to nationals for the first time and competed in Personal Finance. “My favorite part about Nationals was meeting people from across the country who share similar interest as me,” says Raymond. “FBLA has definitely taught me to be more comfortable talking to people and shown me interests I didn’t know I had before”.  

The East High chapter hopes to really focus on the 2020 competition and double the numbers for next year's national experience.
