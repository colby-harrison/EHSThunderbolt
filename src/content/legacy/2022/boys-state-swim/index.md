The Boys Swim Team competed at the state meet. Fighting through all adversity, including not having a pool, the team pushed through and placed 10th overall. Caleb Ruff, 10, was the only swimmer who qualified, he placed 12th in the 200 Yard IM, with a time of 2:15.66.

Ruff says, “State wasn’t as good as I’d hoped it be, but I think that’s mainly because we didn’t have a pool. We couldn’t have morning practices, and that pushed us back on the number of yards we could get each day.”

Devin Meyer, 10, a diver, placed 4th with a score of 374.50. Tru-Lee Holz, 10, placed 8th with the score of 314.45. “I’m pretty proud of how I placed, because I dislocated my shoulder in the middle of the season.” Holz is excited to see how his next two seasons go.
