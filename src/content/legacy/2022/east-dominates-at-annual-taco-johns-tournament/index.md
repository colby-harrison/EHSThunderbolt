The annual Taco John’s tournament went extremely well for our girls' and boys' basketball teams. After a couple of long weekends of traveling the teams were able to play in their home thunderbird gym for the first time in almost two years do to Covid and the construction in the gyms. The teams also experienced some adversity in the games against Rock Springs and Natrona. However, they were able to pull through and took a hard-fought win against both teams.

“It was exciting to play in the Thunderdome again”, says Boden Liljedahl (11th). Liljedahl enjoys the way the community comes out to support the T-birds at home and witness the talent on the team. In relation to how the tournament went she says, “The tournament went really well. There were some good teams we played to challenge us a little more and see what we can improve on. We faced some adversity in our third game for the first time this season so it was great to see how our team would respond to that".

Drew Jackson,10, a lead scorer and key energy giver to the boys varsity team also commented, “We played pretty good and won all 3 games, there's still some stuff we can improve on but overall we had a good tournament".
