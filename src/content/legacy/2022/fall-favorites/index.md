What’s better than a big comfy hoodie and a pumpkin spice latte?

One good thing about Wyoming is that we experience every season at its full potential. Therefore, the fall experience is one that outshines the rest. In my opinion, I think that fall is the best season because of the clothes, football games, treats, and holidays.  

While summer does get a lot of credit for the warm weather and the ability to do more outdoor activities, I do believe fall activities are superior. Carving pumpkins, the Friday night football games, pumpkin patches, and haunted houses, to me are much more exciting.

With fall activities also comes fall flavors and treats such as pumpkin pies, pumpkin spice lattes, and all the delicious foods that come with celebrating Thanksgiving. Along with the crisp fall air, the scenery of fall is the most beautiful. The color-changing leaves are enough to make any dull place seem bright and colorful.  The weather outshines the rest due to the fact that it is a nice in-between.  

My absolute favorite thing about fall is the fashion. In my opinion, dressing up gets exhausting, and wearing a comfy sweater with a warm pair of sweats without any judgment is something I look forward to every year. For anyone who does enjoy putting effort into outfits, fall sweaters, cardigans, and jackets are the perfect route to go. Being comfy and fashionable is so easy to do in the fall.  

Fall is undoubtedly the perfect balance between warm and cold weather, fashion, activities, and more. When it comes to fall, no other season can compete.
