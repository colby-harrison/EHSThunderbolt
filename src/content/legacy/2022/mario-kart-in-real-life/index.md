Winter came late this year, but now it is rolling in fast. East is filled with a range of driving skills when Sophomores are learning to drive for the first time and teachers have years of experience under their belt. As Cheyenne temperatures drop, the range in skill becomes plain to see as the snow is white and it can be dangerous driving this time of year. Snow falls through the night making it difficult to see the parking lines and the roads become slick with ice.

“You can’t park in any of the corner parking spots because there are snow drifts there,” says Asher Turner, 12. With less available parking spots and snow still falling, accidents are prone to happen. “I had to park between two trucks who were very close together. It was slippery and I accidentally hit a car but they were nice about it.”  

Snow isn’t the only factor that can cause the parking lots to be chaotic.

“Most of the Seniors and Juniors are okay. The big trucks or Sophomores starting to drive are probably the biggest problem,” Turner continues. “The regular parking lot is probably the worst. The church parking lot seems pretty chill.”

As the winter season progresses and even once the warmer season begins, all students and faculty members should remember to be cautious and drive safely on the roads and in parking lots.
