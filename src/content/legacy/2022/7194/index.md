CDE (Career Development Event) season is among us, and FFA (Future Farmers of America) members are prepping for state through practice competitions in Sheridan, Casper, and Powell Wyoming. There are many events FFA members can compete in, that may reflect what they would like to do for their future career. Veterinary Science, Livestock Judging, Environment and Natural Resources, Parliamentary Procedure, Ag Sales, Extemporaneous Speech, Prepared Speech, Creed Speech, Horse Judging, and Meats are some examples of the different competitions the FFA members participate in this season. So far, the teams have gone through several different competitions in speech, and Job Skills. The ENR, Sales, and the Vet Science teams competed in Sheridan at the Sheridan Boarder Wars practice competition on March 7th. The Sales team took first, with the highest scores, and placed top 12 individually. While the ENR team placed 8th, and the Vet Science team placed 16th. Later on this month the teams will be competing in Powell and Casper for another practice competition, to determine their placings for state convention in April.
