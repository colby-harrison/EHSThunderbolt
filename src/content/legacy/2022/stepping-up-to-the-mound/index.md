With the spring season starting, home pitcher Jaylyn Christenson, 11 stepped up and made a name for herself at the first invite of the season with 17 strikeouts and only having four hits get by her. 

 “There were times last season that I struggled with preparing myself mentally, and I would get so nervous,” Christensen said in an interview with wyosports.net, “I’d also get down on myself. I’ve had to remind myself that my coaches believe in me, so I should believe in myself.”  

Christensen had to be mentally and physically ready for the 2021-2022 softball season for East high school.  

“I thought it was pretty cool, and I mean I never thought I would earn that because I feel like it is a really hard thing to, but I did work my butt off in practice,” Christensen said. 

 On the week of March 23, she was awarded the prep athlete of the week and WY sports athlete as well. “I know I need to step up and be a leader on the team. I just think having a positive mind set and knowing that you’re not doing your greatest you still have your team behind you cheering you on,” Christensen said.  

She has stepped up to the mound and made a difference for herself and her team this year.
