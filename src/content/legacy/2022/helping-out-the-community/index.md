This year East’s Future Farmers of America (FFA) put on a canned food drive to help the community. Each club had the chance to win and as a result slime their organization leader. Over 1820  cans were donated and will be going to the Comea Journey Center and the Salvation Army. The East High community really came together this year because they actually collected too many cans. The Comea Journey center reached their capacity with donations, so the rest were given elsewhere.  Competitions like these are a great way to get students involved and get everyone to want to participate. Speech and Debate won this year’s competition and  Mr. Viney was slimed on TBTV along with principal,  Mr.Haggerdy.
