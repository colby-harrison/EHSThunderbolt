After 4 years of waiting, the seniors of the East girls' soccer team finally get to play Kelly Walsh and Natrona for the pre-season games. Every year, these 2 highly anticipated games get cancelled due to harsh weather. Since these games are not regular season games, because Kelly Walsh and Natrona are not in our conference, they have never been rescheduled. After a long wait and hopes for good weather, our girls' soccer team will be able to play the 2 teams from Casper. 

 “These games are super important for our team to work together in a game situation before our season officially starts," said varsity midfielder Tayler Miller, "It has been very frustrating to not be able to play these teams since my freshman year, but I am glad I got to play them my senior year.”

These games are a great way to kick off the soccer season for East High school.
