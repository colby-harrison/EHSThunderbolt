The Boys Swim Team has put up with many obstacles, including not having their own pool. And that is the biggest obstacle of all time for a swim team, not being able to compete at your own school, and constantly having to plan their schedule around another team. Even though the team is still putting up with this obstacle, due to the pool still being the building process; they will get to have almost their whole season in the new pool.  

“I’m really excited for it, it’s going to be nice to have a lot of room for practice, and we can be way more efficient,” says Caleb Ruff, 10.  

The team has been working hard and they are all planning to achieve all their goals. 

 “I want to improve on my times from last year and hopefully place top 6 at state.”
