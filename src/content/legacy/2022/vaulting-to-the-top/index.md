Our girls pole vaulting team are working hard this season with their new coach, Greg Sawyer. Coach Sawyer is a formal division 1 athlete, competing in track, and basketball. The team is thrilled to learn from him, and excited for the opportunity to work with him. So far, these girls have competed in six meets, Caydence Eicholtz, has placed top five in every meet that she’s competed in, making her the top vaulter for East High.  Caydence puts in lots of hard work during the off season and is excited to see it pay off.

“During the summer, I go to pole vault camps. I also lift to work on my upper body strength, and I try to attend spring camps that East holds, just to get faster. Drills are always really important, as they say practice makes perfect,” says Eicholtz.

Eicholtz is currently vaulting 9’6”, and her goal for state is to PR, with 10’. As she continues to work hard, she hopes to end the season with a new PR.

“The only thing I wanted from this season was to see genuine improvement in my vaults, and so far I think I’ve accomplished that, I can’t wait to see what Outdoor has in store,” says Eicholtz.

Her drive to see improvement in herself is an important aspect to see in an athlete, and East is excited to see what she can do.
