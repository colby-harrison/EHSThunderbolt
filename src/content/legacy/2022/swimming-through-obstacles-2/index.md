The Boys Swim Team has put up with many obstacles, among the many not having their own pool, is the biggest obstacle of all time for a swim team. Not being able to compete at your own school and constantly having to plan their schedule around other teams. Even though the team is still putting up with this obstacle, due to the pool still being in the building process; they will get to have some of their season in the new pool.

“I’m really excited for it, it’s going to be nice to have a lot of room for practice, and we can be way more, efficient,” says Caleb Ruff, 10.

The team had been working hard and they are all planning to achieve all their goals, despite this obstacle. “I want to improve on my times from last year and hopefully place top 6 at state,” says Ruff.
