Self-love is also important to most people on Valentine’s Day. Sometimes buying yourself chocolate, flowers and gifts is just what you need to feel “the love” on Valentine’s Day. 

Even though there are a lot of people that don’t like Valentine’s Day, they still want to show compassion towards the people they love. ROTC Teacher Lt. Col Christopher Johnson, said, “I’m not a really big fan of Valentine’s Day, however because I love my wife so much and I think it’s important to show my love to her. Every year, I always do something special for her on Valentine’s Day. The best thing I ever gave her for Valentine's Day was a big heart shaped, 15-pound chocolate box.”  

Valentine’s Day is a very well-known and popular holiday today. Everyone has their own unique way of celebrating, whether that be celebrating with family, friends or a significant other. Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be a burden for all you single Pringles, but a day to show love to loved ones.
