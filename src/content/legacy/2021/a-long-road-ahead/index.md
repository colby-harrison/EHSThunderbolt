After earning the state title last year, Lady Tbird basketball holds a big target on their back for this 2021-2022 season. Defending state champions may hold a lot of pressure for the girls and push them to maintain their title. In an interview with the head coach, Eric Westling says,  “I think it’s always harder the second time to do something that nobody thought you were gonna do, and repeating that same kind of outcome gets to be harder because now everyone knows how good our program is.” 

   As for the pressure of the task, Westling believes it’s all mental. “some people can put a lot of pressure on themselves. As a coach you have to think, are your players having fun? Are they doing the right things in the game to learn outside the game? That’s how you don’t have as much pressure” 

 The girls and coaches continue to work hard every day and come together in practice. Many parents, fans, and opponents are looking forward to watching the lady tbirds play. Coach is most excited for simply watching his girls have fun playing basketball this season.

 The girls have a long season ahead of them and lots of time to grow together and as players, but most importantly to enjoy the sport and each others company.
