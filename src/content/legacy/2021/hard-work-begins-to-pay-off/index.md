Last weekend the girls Swimming and Diving made a trip to Gillette for the first Invite of the season. Overall, the team took 14th out of 19 teams, but Jeorgia Yates, senior, took 10th out of 38 divers, coming out with a new personal record of 314.30 points. Sydni Sawyer, sophomore, East’s newest addition to the team, took 6th place in the 200 IM, and took 9th place in the 100 breaststroke. “I felt good swimming, although I was very tired and sore, I just had to push through it and race to the best of my ability,” said Sawyer.  

This upcoming weekend, the girls will be competing at the regional competition, which will take place at South High School. “I think East will surprise people at conference. The girls have been working hard and are really broken down right now. We just started the buildup process and should see some good time drops this weekend at conference,” Coach Jon Anderson. The girls have overcome many obstacles with not having their own pool to swim in, but as the season comes to an end, the girls continue to keep pushing and get better every day.
