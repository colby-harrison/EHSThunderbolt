Festive and frightful come together in Henry Selick's twisted film _The Nightmare Before Christmas._ Although this movie is a classic the big question still remains, is it a Christmas movie or a Halloween movie?

The student body from East high school was asked on whether or not they believed the movie _The Nightmare before Christmas_ should be categorized as a Halloween or a Christmas movie. Overall, 61.54% of the students asked said they would categorize the movie as a Halloween movie.

“ I would say Christmas, because it’s Jack sort of finding the true meaning of Christmas instead of his own ideology of it.” 11th grader, Joise Brown said.

“The protagonists of the movie are from Halloween Town where most of the movie is set. Also, with the terrifying gifts that Jack Skeleton gives, it shows that he never legitimately strays from his Halloween mindset.” 11th grader, Ellie Swanson said

Whether or not you watch the movie during Christmas or Halloween time it is still a good movie overall.
