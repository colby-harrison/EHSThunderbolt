There are a variety of activities to participate in during summer in Cheyenne. For some FFA (Future Farmers of America) and 4H (Head, Heart, Hands, Health) members, many of them choose to spend their summer working hard to get ready for the Laramie County Fair. This year the fair was from August 4th to August 14th, although the exhibitors spend much more time than that in preparation. Haylie Turley, senior, is an FFA and 4H Member who worked hard this year and showed in the fair.

“I was able to show two market steers. One of them was able to sell in the FFA Kiwanis sale, which is highly competitive. I was also able to sell in the 4H sale,” says Turley.

Her accomplishments in fair don’t come easy. Raising animals can be hard work and a big commitment. “It’s almost a year long process,” tells Turley.

“We get the calves around November or sometimes as early as September. You need to teach them to lead and boundaries. You need to bathe them early on. You need to get them fitted and ready to show.”

Turley is only one example of an FFA member here who had a good year at fair. “One of our discovery members, Reagan Allen, was able to show and sell multiple animals. We had 3 members total, I think, sell in the FFA sale, which is huge,” says Turley.

East had a successful year at fair from members winning market or showmanship to winning awards for static exhibits.Students work extraordinarily hard for fair, and it's not just for kicks. Haylie Turley advocates for all the opportunities given by showing.

“There are opportunities for money and scholarships. Anyone can show. I love fair so much because there really are no stereotypes in fair. Everyone comes together with their own purpose and work hard. For Frontier FFA, we had an exceptional year.”
