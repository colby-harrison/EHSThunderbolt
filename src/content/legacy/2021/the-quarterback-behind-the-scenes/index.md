Hard work and dedication. Practice after practice. Being a quarterback is more than just throwing the ball to his receivers. There are only seconds to think about what you’re doing and there’s strategy behind every throw. While everyone is yelling at Gavin Goff, 12, for making the smallest mistake, he feels like the worlds on his shoulders. On the outside this position may look easy, on the inside, being the quarterback takes a lot.

“There was a lot of going and throwing with my friends during the summer. I also did a lot more shoulder workouts to help my throwing this season”. He never let his team to face their challenges alone, "I watched a lot of film with Coach Nelson, helping reading coverages, broke down the film from the other team saying what I saw, and just helping any way I can”,

Goff tore his ACL during the East vs. Central game, but that didn't stop him from being at every game cheering his team on from the sidelines from the sideline.

Despite that hard time thrown at him, he still had good memories from the season, “It was our first team dinner, and we were at Brian's house playing ping pong. But we were playing it where the whole team was playing it and we were in a big circle around the ping pong table, and we would take turns hitting it and dropping the paddle then rotating. If you messed up, then you were out, and we would then narrow it down to 1v1 and see who would win.”

He had many other good memories from this, he felt very close to his team this year and with every obstacle he had to overcome, he always had his team to back him up.
