Cross Country is a hard sport to stick with, however the hard work of these athletes has led them to a great place: state. “My big goal this year has been to try and get into the 16’s this year, because I try to drop a minute every year,” says Owen Wise, 12. The ambitions of the athletes make the sport worth trying. “My goal for state is to get one last PR for my Senior year, so under a 20:48,” says Alleynah Ronnau, 12. The athletes work hard all season working towards the final race. “We didn’t end up doing them this year, but I love mile repeats, they suck, but they’re worth it,” says Wise.

Every workout, every long run, every step these athletes take strengthen their mindset and make the payoff of a good race even more exciting. Cross Country isn’t just an individual sport, relying on a single athlete’s work, but a team sport as well. “I love the environment of cross country, how people are just so nice and friendly, and everyone’s always joking around,” says Ronnau. The ‘family feel’ of the sport leads to a great bond among the team and friendships that will last years to come.
