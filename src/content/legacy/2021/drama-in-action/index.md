Every year East High puts on a drama production, different from the year before. This years’ musical, _All Together Now_ is very unique because of its style and reflection of life during COVID. “Our whole theme is throughout these songs we say things differently about quarantine and 2020 as a whole, and how we survived through that,” says Emma Mayfield, Junior.

The preparation for this show is time consuming but worth it according to Mayfield, “We have rehearsals Monday through Thursday while we try to piece everything together in the final 15 days.” Hard work and dedication are needed for this cast to get through each song and dance as the opening day nears. “Putting choreography to the words is how I remember each song,” Mayfield says as the assistant choreographer for the musical. The cast has become a family as they work through each act and the older kids take the younger ones under their wing. This show is something you won’t want to miss, as it is nothing like you’ve ever seen before.
