One of our East High athletes is making headlines. Elysiana Fonseca was announced Prep Athlete of the week on October 4, 2021. Elysiana showed great enthusiasm and surprise when the news was announced. In an interview she states, “ I think it is was very cool because it is a big achievement.” Elysiana continues to work hard and earn these deserving titles.

“It means a lot to me because it feels like my hard work paid off,” Elysiana says. She plans on growing and continuing her volleyball career after high school, but is still weighing options and in the midst of deciding where to go for college. Fonseca pushes herself hard in practices every day and says she worked a lot and pushed herself to accomplish this achievement.
