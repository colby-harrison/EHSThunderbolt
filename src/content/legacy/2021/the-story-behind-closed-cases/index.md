It is a well-known fact that victims’ families are affected by their loved one’s cases going unsolved without justice, but how do the officers who are working on the case feel about it? On November 9th 2021 Detective Jerry Walker was interviewed on the workings of cold cases “If you can’t solve them, that’s always frustrating cause you always want to try and get the best result for your victims, but in a lot of investigations once you hit a dead end and you’ve ran it as far as you can it’s disappointing. On the flip side when you do get a tip and it checks out, it’s a good feeling when new information helps you. You get some justice,” said Walker. Luckily for Cheyenne, there is only have one inactive case that could be considered cold, the coin shop homicide on July, 20th , 2015. There are a total of 10,351 inactive cases in Wyoming as of November, 15th, 2021. Cheyenne is grateful to have the amazing officers we do who work hard to solve cases for their victims.
