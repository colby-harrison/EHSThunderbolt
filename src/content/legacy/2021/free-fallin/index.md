On the long record of the things to do on both Mrs. Heather Tyrrell and Mrs. Cynthia Prevedel’s bucket lists, skydiving was high at the top, they finally fulfilled this late September. They both decided to test their bravery at Mile High Skydiving Center in Loveland and their aerial experiences exceeded their expectations. 

The nerves were extremely high prior to the event with Tyrrell stating, “Your adrenaline starts pumping and your heart beats really fast. You keep asking yourself ‘ Am I really going to jump out of this plane?’ and I was just very nervous.” 

 Prevedel was having similar feelings on the thought of jumping at such an intimidating height, in which she said, “I felt super nervous, but it was something I’ve always wanted to do so I pushed through.” 

 Although the fear levels were high prior to the jump, all the stress was released the moment they decided to jump off the plane, granting them a unique feeling and worked as an incredible mood booster for the day as well as the days following the event, “It was a rush. You are on like this little high for a couple days after just because your adrenaline was so high at that one point”, said Tyrrell. 

 The experience was a strange feeling they have never felt before yet it was a feeling they craved for again. Prevedel explained that “It was incredible, it felt as if time was slowed down.” 

Tyrrell and Prevedel enjoyed the experience more than they thought, prompting them to go through the experience all over again on a second skydiving run. Tyrrell found herself enjoying it better the second time since she wasn’t so overwhelmed, explaining that “I could actually look around and notice things where as the first time I was just looking at the ground.” The skydiving duo has also made future plans for more skydiving trips to the check off their bucket list. The experience was more than fulfilling and has led to a new spontaneous hobby.
