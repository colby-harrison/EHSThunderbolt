Many students throughout East High School have different opinions on the mask mandate for the schools in our district. If you walked throughout the school and in between classes and paid attention, you would be able to tell who's for it and who's against it because of the way people wear their masks. Some classes have kids wearing them correctly, wearing them below their noses or underneath their chin or sometimes even they have it completely off. This is how you can mostly tell who is against or for the mask mandate at the schools of Cheyenne.  

Emma Klungness, Sophomore, has a big opinion on wearing masks, like many other students do at East High. She feels like it should not be a thing because we are not able to show who we are, what we look like, and is against our health. She thinks people should have the right to show who they are. Klungness respects those that think there should be a mandate, but her opinion is it is making her feel like she cannot show herself and be who she wants to be. Some people disagree and agree but its all based on their opinion. Klungness says, “I feel like we should have still had the choice to be able to wear our masks or not but that’s just me, like yes I know the numbers were rising for Covid and all in the district, but this is my opinion and I stick to it even if people disagree with me or not.”  Klungness understands that the mandate is to be able to keep us in school in person.
