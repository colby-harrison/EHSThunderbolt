Thousands of phones pinging, and radios buzzing, like an amber alert but “scarier”? A nationwide alert is set to go off October 4th, 2023.  The question everyone keeps asking, “Why would this even be necessary to do?”. According to CBS News, it is marking the 7th nationwide Emergency Alert System ever conducted. Previous tests have been conducted between 2011 and 2021, but this is only the third test for wireless alerts, and the second for all cell phones. So, to revisit a major question getting asked, why is the feature even necessary?

“I think this feature could be very important if something in the US was to happen.” Said Kailey Williams, 12. “Like, what if there was some major weather disaster to happen and there was no way to contact certain people. I think it’s definitely nice to have the feature, but I hope that it never has to be actually used.”

But not everyone agrees with Williams.

“I don’t like that the government has access to every single person’s phone.” said Makayla Trippel, 11. “Its crazy to me that no matter who you are, where you are, or no matter the type of technology around you, there is a way that the government can get ahold of you.”.

So as a cell phone owner, is it something to worry about or can it be disabled?

This is a mandatory test required by the government and, according to CBS News, there is little to be concerned about and there is nothing you can do to disable this feature. It is a safety feature required to occur by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), to ensure that the system in place is still effective in warning the public about issues at a national level.

So, what if you don’t want to hear it? If you don’t want to hear it, you can just power off devices that are expected to receive an alert.

“I would be scared if I had a hidden phone, like domestic abuse victims,” said Murphie Dahill, 11. “It would just scare me that the abuser could find it, I feel like it would just lead to more problems.”ehs It could potentially save people in tough situations that would need to hide an additional piece of technology.

While the alarm may be inconvenient and noisy, the government is working hard to help with safety and awareness. Don’t be surprised to have another test.
