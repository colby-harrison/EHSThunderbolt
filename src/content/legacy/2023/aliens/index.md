Do aliens exist? Do you ever think you see a shooting stair in the sky and think it looks like a flying saucer? Do you ever think you see a little non-human figure running around? This is a really interesting question and one that NASA has been trying to understand, explore, and figure out figure out for a long time. We have not yet discovered life on any other planet, and we have not seen any scientifically supported evidence for extraterrestrial life.

NASAs definition of habitable environments continues to expand. Off the earth we've only begun to look. NASA has sent five rovers and four landers the surface of Mars. We have only explored a little bit of the planet, that's only one of the promising bodies to look for life in are solar system.

Do our East High students think aliens are real or not?

"I believe that aliens are real because with all the galaxies and space that hasn't been discovered there is no way that there isn't any other life form,” said Vesper Seitz 10.

Vesper explains that with all the galaxies in the world there has to be aliens out there.

"Yes because with all the galaxy we have and all the space we have it would be stupid to believe that aliens aren't real,” said Bailey Paul 10.

Bailey expresses that we would have to be stupid to not believe in them or any other life form. Then we have students who would disagree with Vesper and Bailey.

"No I don't believe that aliens are real because they haven't tried to communicate with us there's been no real proof of them because the government hasn't given any actual proof of aliens existing" said Olivia Martinez 10. Olivia explains to us that there is not enough evidence that there is alien life out there and that every sighting that we’ve had of alien life has just been a misunderstanding.

Do you believe that aliens are real? Is there another life form running around this planet? Is it all just a big misunderstanding?
