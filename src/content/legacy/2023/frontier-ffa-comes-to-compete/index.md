10 out of 10! The Frontier FFA chapter competed against FFA chapters from around the state. At the Archer Fair Grounds August 9th to the 12th. many of the Frontier FFA members showed off not only their summer projects like sheep, pigs, goats, and horses to the judges, but many of the Frontier FFA CDE teams made a statement as well up at the Wyoming state fair.  

"A lot of our kids did awesome with placing their animals and selling their animals," said Joseph Allen, Frontier FFA advisor.  Allen felt that the Frontier FFA chapter performed well in the show ring and the sale ring. “The students worked really hard, I did a lot of project visits through the summer as well,” said Allen.  

"I performed really well with my horses and my goats, and my cats were pretty good.” said Callie Rosner “overall, I'm really happy with how I did," said Rosner, 11. Rosner had a show season full of success between her cats, horses, and goats, competing in the highest level of competition at the Laramie County Fair. 

Many students have achieved more success than before.  

"I felt that this year has been definingly my most successful year,” said Jayden Riddle, 12. Riddle has been showing pigs at the Laramie County Fair for 3 years. Jayden felt more successful this year than any other year, placing higher in her classes, and selling for a higher amount of money at the end of the showing season. Riddle took over the officer position for the Frontier FFA this summer. “We had more people involved in fair and showing than we have previously,” said Riddle, 12.  

FFA skills are skills students can apply to their life.  

"I continue to show my goats, sheep, and pigs, as well as judging livestock across the state," said Regan Allen, 10. Allen is a big part of the frontier FFA. Regan shows her sheep, goats, and pigs at the Laramie County Fair and the Wyoming State Fair. Allen is part of the Livestock judging team for the Frontier FFA chapter. The livestock judging team had won first place at the Wyoming state fair. 

This past summer, the success of the members was very profitable and successful. Frontier FFA members who had entered their animal(s) in FFA had the opportunity to get put into the Kawanis sale and earn up to $5000 in pure profit. Not only did the livestock judging team do very well, but other CDE teams like the skillathon team and the produce judging team had also taken first place at the Wyoming State Fair.
