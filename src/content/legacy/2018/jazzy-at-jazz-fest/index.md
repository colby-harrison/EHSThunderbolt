The steady beat of the drum, the warm sound of the woodwinds, the roaring rattle of the brass section all came together as one melodic voice for Jazz Fest. East competed against other high schools in Casper College's 51st Kinser Jazz Festival. The annual concert was performed with Wyoming All-State Jazz Band as the opening act.

"Jazz Fest was cool and fun," stated Zamboni Brown, senior and 1st trumpet player for Jazz Band at East.

With the positive feedback Jazz Fest receives, many students attend for multiple years.  The Jazz Fest hosts an opportunity to show off their skill.

"I played to compare to other schools," expressed Emily Strawderman, a trombone player who has been going to Jazz Fest for three years.

The musicians from East that attend the event can improve upon their skill after hearing the judges feedback.  When they receive their ratings, East students can see how they compete against other schools in Wyoming.

"The judges always give advice to improve and there's always something to take away," said senior Lucas Wilcox, drum set for All-State Jazz band.

Held at the John F. Welsh Auditorium at Natrona County High School, the journey for Easts Jazz Band members was exhausting but worth it to learn from the judges at the festival.

"It was my 4th and last time going," said Zamboni Brown.

Zamboni Brown won a solo award for playing _Island Sunrise_, making his last time going to Jazz Fest something to remember.
