As graduation approaches, many seniors are beginning their journey into their futures. They spend extra time looking at colleges, trade schools and jobs that might give them a life course after high school. This can be an especially intense time for athletes looking for the best place to showcase their skills. For a few lucky senior sport stars, their search is over, and they have committed to the college of their dreams. So far this year, a total of seven seniors have signed to play.
