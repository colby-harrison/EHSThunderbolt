At every competition this year, two names stood out for the East High cross-country squads. Seniors Jeremy Rief and MacKenzie Marler have spent their careers as leaders on the course, and they wrapped up their final years with another strong showing.

At the state meet, Rief posted a 9th place finish, posting a time of 16:54.05, and earned all-state honors. He finished in 1st place at the regional meet with a time of 17:13.61.

While she fell short of repeating her 2017 championship, Marler still earned all-state recognition at the state meet in Sheridan with a 9th place finish, crossing the line in 19:16.95. She finished in second place at regionals, posting a 19:48.76. The girls team finished in 11th place at the state meet.
