Growing up, the most common question asked is: "what do you want to be when you grow up?" To answer in short- not yet. Despite the hundreds of times high schoolers are asked, many can't answer with something straight.

Yet here at East, there are some students who can, but it isn't a typical answer with a career that's relatively mindless, it's something more. It's their dreams.

Having a dream is different than knowing what one wants to do when they're older. Because when somebody pursues their dreams they become more passionate about it. And here at East two students are pursuing their dream: Saga Macallister and Nick Kassel.

Saga Macallister, sophomore, dreams of playing music. With her ultimate goal of playing at Red Rocks Ampitheater. When asked how to get there Saga lit up.

"I've been writing on my own for a really long time so, I'm going to start writing with other people soon." Mcallister claimed. "I have a friend who has recording so I'm going to try and get in there to record." When Saga was asked where this dream came from she started by talking about her home life. "I grew up in a pretty musical family, all of my siblings, we all play music or do music in some respect. So, it's kind of been a constant in my life."

Saga has a goal to play more this year and have a full set of songs to perform.

Pursuing dreams can come in many forms, for senior Nick Kassel it comes in the form of hockey.

"My dream is to play hockey for as long as I can." When asked how to get there he immediately launched into his plan. "It's a lot of hard work. I'm practicing for 14 hours a week. But with that hard work and making relationships with coaches and hopefully that'll lead to you getting a recommendation so you can take a shot."

"I've always wanted to be a hockey player," Kassel added. "Like, I cannot remember a time when I haven't wanted to play hockey."

Saga and Nick are just two examples of students who are pursuing their dreams. There are countless others within the school who are running towards their dreams as fast as they can.
