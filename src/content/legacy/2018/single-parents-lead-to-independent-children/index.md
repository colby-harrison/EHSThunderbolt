Many kids face the struggle of being raised in a one-parent home. Too many kids with single parents are just happy with having a roof over their head and food to eat. According to the US Census Bureau, from 1960 to 2016, the percentage of children living with only their mother nearly tripled from 8 to 23 percent, and single father percentages rose from 1 to 4 percent.

Children of single parent often have anger towards the absent adult, but sometimes they can be understanding.

“I don’t hate my mom,” said by anonymous East High student. “Sometimes parents just lose feelings and it happens. It kind of sucks that parents can’t suck it up to be there for their kid but it’s whatever. She lives her life and I live mine.”

Having a single parent brings many struggles and all kids deal with these struggles differently.

“You don’t have someone to rely on because they have work and stuff, so you have to just be more responsible for yourself,” anonymous adds. “No one to wake you up in the morning or remind you that you need to get your homework done.

Some kids in this situation can struggle in school and have limitations in school activities, but that isn’t always the case.

“Having a single parent doesn’t affect my academics, sometimes I try to get good grades so I can show my mom so she’ll be proud of me,” said anonymous. “Since I have a big family, my mom won’t pay for me to go to college, so I try to get good grades and work for the money I need.”

It’s very hard for some kids when they realize that their other parent isn’t a part of their lives. Sometimes these kids wonder what their lives would be like if both parents were still together, but some wouldn’t want anything to change.

“Sometimes I think about how my life would be if I had my dad around,” anonymous added. “I know that things happen for a reason and in the end they can lead to something great.”

Statistics say children from single-parent homes face an uphill battle, but there is always hope. East High counselors and teachers can offer advice and support for all children and families.
