A strong group of underclassmen took the lead this past fall and set the bar high for EHS tennis. After two days of intense regional action in Rock Springs, the girls team brought home a 2nd place finish, while the boys took 5th. Sophomore Lexie Woolridge set the pace for the team, bringing home a second place finish in #1 Singles, losing in the finals to Central’s Kelsey Hardsocg (6-1, 6-0). Junior Grace Regeski dropped a tough match for 4th place in #2 Singles to Torrington’s Sera Glass (7-5, 6-1). In #3 Doubles, Nedra McIlwaine and Savanna Stoddard lost to Cox and Dennis of Laramie (6-3, 6-0) for 4th place. On the boys side, Seth Davidson wrapped up a regional 4th place finish in #1 Singles, losing to Central’s Brian Joelson (6-1, 6-1). In #2 Singles, Mason Paskett outlasted Rawlins’ Jacob Pacheco (6-3, 6-1) to bring home a 3rd place medal.
