There is only a few things a princess marks on her calendar of her last year of high school. Prom may be a senior dance, but it’s important because it’s the final dance of four years of high school. It’s the night of beautiful ball gowns and tuxedos, fancy dinners, and a limousine ride. Every girl dreams of her Prince Charming picking them up on a white horse and taking them to the magical palace. It isn’t the easiest way to say goodbye to high school, leaving so many memories behind, but it’s a night to remember. Prom… the way to remember your best memories and a great way to end high school.
