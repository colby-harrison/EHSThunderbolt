Peyton Westby, a rising star in the wrestling world, is set to take his skills to Ottawa University in Kansas, where he will continue his athletic career. Known for his work ethic and dedication to his team, Westbyâ€™s coaches have praised his relentless drive and willingness to contribute in any way necessary to help the team succeed.

Reflecting on his journey, Westby shared how wrestling and martial arts have helped shape his confidence. "I know if I was talking to myself when I was younger, like when I was 5 or 6, I was a kid with not a lot of confidence. I was scared. Wrestling and martial arts definitely helped that, having an older brother who was there for me definitely helped. It definitely feels really good to finally get to that stage," he said.

Westby's commitment to his sport has led him to this exciting opportunity, where he aims to make a significant impact on the Ottawa University wrestling program.
