Infielder Landon McAnelly has committed to Valley City State University, an NAIA school in Valley City, North Dakota. He chose the school because it felt like home, with welcoming people, supportive coaches, and a positive atmosphere. McAnelly has had a strong career at Post 6, with a .318 batting average, 15 doubles, and 96 RBIs over two varsity seasons. Known for his consistent contact, he has struck out only 32 times in 471 plate appearances. Primarily playing second and third base, McAnelly has mostly played second and third base during his Sixers career but added first base to his repertoire last summer. He is prepared to play anywhere Valley City needs him. Landon states, “I feel like I can play well in all those spots, so I just want to do my best wherever they need me,” said McAnelly, who plans to study physical therapy with the goal of working with professional athletes. “I’m used to moving around,". He plans to acquire a degree in exercise science
