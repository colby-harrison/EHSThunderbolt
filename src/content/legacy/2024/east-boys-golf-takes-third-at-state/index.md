The Cheyenne East boys golf team secured a strong third-place finish at the Wyoming Class 4A State Golf Tournament, held Saturday at Valli Vu Golf Course in Afton.

The Thunderbirds posted a two-round total of 49-over-par 609, finishing just behind state champion Campbell County (599) and runner-up Evanston (608).

East senior Nash Coleman delivered a standout performance, tying for second place individually with Campbell County’s Jaxon Burr at 1-over 141. Coleman shot an impressive bogey-free 2-under 68 in Saturday’s final round, highlighted by birdies on the par-4 1st and 14th holes.

This third-place finish caps off a successful season for the East boys golf team.
