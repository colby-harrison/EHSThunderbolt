he Cheyenne East Thunderbirds ended their remarkable 2024 football season with a second-place finish after falling to Sheridan 21-0 in the state championship game. Despite the loss, the team’s 9-3 record and impressive run to the final reflect a year of growth, hard work, and determination.

In the first half of the state final, East’s defense started strong, shutting down Sheridan’s offensive efforts and keeping the game competitive. Meanwhile, the offense made multiple drives down the field, looking to break through and take control. However, the second half saw a shift. Sheridan came out hot, dominating both sides of the ball and taking advantage of key opportunities. Their offense found a rhythm, while East struggled to respond, unable to score and ultimately falling short.
