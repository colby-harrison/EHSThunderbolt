In a playoff game that will go down as one of the most exciting in recent memory, Cheyenne East stunned Campbell County with a dramatic 35-34 victory in the 4A semi-finals, securing a spot in the state championship for the third consecutive year. The Thunderbirds will face Sheridan in the 4A title game Saturday at 4 p.m. at War Memorial Stadium in Laramie.

The game had everything — explosive offense, tense moments, and a dramatic finish that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

Cheyenne East jumped out to an early 7-0 lead on the back of a 1-yard touchdown run by junior running back Keyshawn Brown.

The Thunderbirds took control in the second quarter, with Brown scoring again — this time on a 2-yard run — to extend the lead to 14-6. Fellow senior Nolan Horton added a 7-yard touchdown run to push the lead to 21-6
