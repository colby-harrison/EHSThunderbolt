Last weekend, East High School's FFA and SkillsUSA organizations hosted their much-anticipated **Fall on the Farm** event, transforming the school grounds at 2800 East Pershing into a lively fall festival. Running from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday, the event attracted families, students, and community members for two full days of autumn-themed fun.

**Pumpkin Patch and Petting Zoo** At the heart of the event was the vibrant pumpkin patch, offering all kinds, sizes, and colors of pumpkins for purchase. Whether visitors were looking for the perfect pumpkin to carve or simply to add to their fall décor, the patch had something for everyone. Alongside the pumpkins, kids were thrilled by the petting zoo, where they could interact with friendly goats and donkeys.

**Activities for All Ages** To keep the little ones entertained, there was a variety of activities, including face painting and hair tinsel booths, which were a hit among the younger attendees. Families could also enjoy classic farm-themed games that provided lighthearted competition and fun. Whether tossing a beanbag or participating in a friendly relay, there were plenty of opportunities for both kids and adults to engage in some wholesome fun.

**Local Vendors and Treats** Beyond the activities, Fall on the Farm featured an impressive vendor fair, offering a range of products from local artisans. Attendees could browse through booths selling handcrafted jewelry, fresh honey, Avon products, baked goods, Christmas ornaments, homemade soap, and more. For those craving fall treats, fresh donuts and warm coffee were available, making the day complete with seasonal flavors.

**Supporting a Good Cause** The event wasn't just about fun – it also served as a community-building effort, supporting local businesses and raising awareness for FFA and SkillsUSA's initiatives. These two student-led organizations work to develop leadership and career skills, and their efforts in putting together Fall on the Farm highlighted their commitment to the school and community.

With pumpkins, games, vendors, and delicious treats, **Fall on the Farm** proved to be a weekend of joy and connection for all who attended. The event brought families together to celebrate the beauty of fall while supporting a great cause.
