Coming back from the new year

New Year’s Day is on the first day of January, for the Laramie County school district 1 the students come back to school on the second day of January. We wanted to know how the students felt coming back from the new year’s.

 

“I felt excited to come back into a new year knowing that I only have two more years until I graduate high school” Kaia Thaler, 10.

“I felt a little sad because the holiday season is over but now, I get to look forward to our future and to see what’s in store, weather good or bad I know I can make it though it, no matter how bad I want to give up” Talea Lzagurrie, 10.

“I fell rejuvenated like it’s a new year and a fresh start to do something good” Tyler Bathke, 10.

The East High students seem super excited to be back for the new year and have a fresh start with everything and have a wonderful year learning and growing. Coming back from break, with the break being over that means that the East High students made it through half of the school year.
