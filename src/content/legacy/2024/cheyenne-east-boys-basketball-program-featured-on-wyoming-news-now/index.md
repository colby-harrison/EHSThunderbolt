The Cheyenne East boys’ basketball team recently made headlines on Wyoming News Now, showcasing their preparation for an exciting new chapter. With a first-year head coach and a mix of seasoned players and fresh talent, the Thunderbirds are determined to continue their legacy of success while promoting their program’s commitment to growth and excellence.

The news segment emphasized the challenges facing East, including the loss of key players Drew Jackson and Cam Hayes, as well as adapting to the leadership of new head coach Sly Johnson. Despite these hurdles, the team’s outlook remains positive, with Johnson expressing enthusiasm for the journey ahead.

“Right now, it’s about learning and growing together,” Johnson said during the interview. “Kids are coming to practice, they're working hard, they don't have excuses and they're being locked in. That's our model this year: being locked in.”

Senior point guard Cam Hassler also shared his perspective during the segment, summarizing the team’s focus for the season. “Our goal is simple: to win,” he said. “We’re going to give it our all every game, whether it’s a blowout or a gritty one.”

The feature highlighted the team’s determination to fill the void left by last year’s top scorers. Players like senior forward Treyden Johnson are stepping up to seize their moment and contribute to the team’s success.

“I'm ready to play, we've got lots to prove” Treyden said.

The segment also spotlighted the Thunderbirds’ recent accomplishments, including a 2023 state championship and three consecutive years with over 22 wins. While this year brings new challenges, Coach Johnson’s leadership and the players’ drive to succeed were front and center in the news coverage, showing the community that East is ready to tackle the season with focus and passion.

East’s season kicks off on December 13 against Evanston, and the team is eager to demonstrate their hard work on the court. As seen on Wyoming News Now, the Thunderbirds’ commitment to teamwork, preparation, and perseverance promises an exciting season ahead.

This feature not only celebrated the program’s resilience but also served as a reminder of the strong tradition and support surrounding East basketball.
