The Art Club’s pumpkin painting event on October 15th was a great success! Many members, along with their siblings and parents, showed up and contributed their creativity to paint some truly impressive pumpkins. The atmosphere was filled with laughter and the smell of fresh paint as everyone enjoyed the festive activity. From spooky designs to playful and colorful pumpkins, each creation added a unique touch to the event.

Looking ahead, Art Club is excited to participate in this year’s Safe Trick-or-Treat event. Continuing with our recurring theme of Tim Burton characters, we’ll be embracing the whimsical and slightly spooky vibes that Burton is known for. Whether it’s Jack Skellington, Sally, or other beloved characters from his iconic films, these themes always bring excitement and creativity to the event. Club members are looking forward to handing out candy and hosting small, fun games for the trick-or-treaters. The decorations for this event will be handmade during our Tuesday after-school meetings, giving members a chance to add their artistic flair to the setup.

As a reminder, Art Club will not be meeting on November 26th, just two days before Thanksgiving break. We hope everyone enjoys their time with family and friends during the holiday. Stay tuned for more exciting events coming up as we head into the holiday season!
