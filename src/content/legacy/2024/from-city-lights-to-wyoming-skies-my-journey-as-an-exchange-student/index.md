As an exchange student in America, I arrived with a mix of excitement and curiosity, mostly shaped by what I had seen in movies and on social media. I experienced big cities, fast-paced lifestyle, and diverse cultural experiences. However, being placed in Wyoming was a surprise that quickly changed my view of the U.S.

Wyoming is nothing like that big city pulse I had imagined. It’s quiet, with big open landscapes, towering mountains, and small towns where everyone seems to know each other. At first, the slower pace felt a little isolating, and i missed the energy of a bigger city. But soon, I began to appreciate the beauty of the state, the endless sky, the uneven outdoors, and the strong sense of community.

What surprised me most was how friendly and welcoming people are. I was quickly embraced by my host family and sport team, who were eager to show me the oval culture. Even though I’ve only been here for a short amount of time, Wyoming taught me a side of America I never expected: a quieter, more nature focused lifestyle that values independence and community.

Looking back, I’m grateful for the experience. Wyoming gave me a deeper understanding of America’s regional diversity, and I found a sense of belonging in an unexpected place. I am happy to be spending my year in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
