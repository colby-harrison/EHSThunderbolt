The school’s latest holiday apparel—a Halloween-themed shirt—is now on sale for $12. Designed and produced by Sarah Marotz, Maycee Hastings, Noah Jackson, Makayla Trippel, Jesse Kirkbride, and Natalie Moore, this limited-edition shirt features the new T-Bird logo and comes in both white and black options, making it a great way to show off school spirit. Students can purchase the shirt by visiting Garcia in Room 205 during first period, every day from 7:45 to 9:13 AM. Cash is preferred, but card payments are also accepted. If students are unable to leave their first period, shirts will also be available for purchase after school on game days when the T-Bird Nest is open. The designs can be seen displayed in the hallway by the T-Bird Nest store at the front of the school. Sizes are limited, so act fast before they sell out!
