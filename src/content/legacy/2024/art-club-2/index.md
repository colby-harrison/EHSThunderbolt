The Art Club is set for an exciting lineup of trips and activities this season! First up, on **November 12**, members will be heading to the **Botanic Gardens** right after school to experience the stunning **DÃ­a de los Muertos** exhibit. The bus will depart at 3 PM and return to school at 4:15 PM. This exhibit promises a vibrant look into Mexican traditions honoring loved ones, with intricate ofrendas, colorful papel picado, and more.

On **December 3**, Art Club has a full-day field trip planned. While the destination is still being finalized, club members are looking forward to another immersive experience that will spark their creativity and deepen their artistic appreciation.

In addition to trips, the club is joining forces with **CTE** on **November 21** after school to sell handmade ornaments and earrings. This event is a great opportunity to support both clubs while finding unique holiday gifts crafted by our talented students.

**Reminder:** There will be no Art Club meeting the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break.

With so many activities lined up, Art Club members are encouraged to participate and make the most of these opportunities to expand their creative horizons!
