This Thanksgiving season, the boys' basketball teams from East, Central, and South High Schools are teaming up for a heartwarming cause. On Saturday, November 23rd, from noon to 6 PM, the teams will be at four local grocery stores collecting food donations for the Comea Shelter on Lincolnway.

You can find the teams at these locations:

- **Albertsons - Yellowstone**
- **Albertsons - Pershing**
- **Walmart - Dell Range**
- **Safeway - South**

Items being collected include Thanksgiving essentials like stuffing mix, canned vegetables, instant potatoes, cranberry sauce, turkeys, and pies.

This inter-triad collaboration is a chance to show community spirit and ensure a warm holiday meal for those in need. Join the effort and make a difference this Thanksgiving!
