Last week, on Tuesday, October 8th, East High School Tennis held its year-end banquet at Sandford's Pub and Grub to celebrate the conclusion of a memorable season. The evening was filled with camaraderie, reflection, and appreciation as players, parents, and coaches gathered to honor the achievements of the tennis program.

East High Tennis provided a delicious spread of food and desserts, ensuring that everyone enjoyed the night. The banquet wasn’t just about the food, though—it was about celebrating the hard work and dedication of the team throughout the season.

A special part of the evening was the awarding of varsity letters to both boys and girls who earned a spot on the varsity squad. The recognition of these athletes' hard work and commitment was met with cheers from the crowd. In addition to varsity letters, a heartfelt thank you was given to the senior players, who played their final matches for East High this season. The banquet also acknowledged the efforts of junior varsity players, whose dedication continues to support the program’s future success.

As the tennis season came to a close, the banquet provided a meaningful opportunity to reflect on the team’s achievements, celebrate personal milestones, and look ahead to the future. Both players and coaches expressed their gratitude for the support of families and the school, making the event a true celebration of the East High tennis community.
