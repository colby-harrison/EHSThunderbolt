Several East High School teachers are hoping to be awarded Cheyenne Schools Foundation Grants, giving them the opportunity to enhance their curriculum and provide unique learning experiences for students. The grants are made possible by the generosity of local businesses, community members, service groups, and Laramie County School District #1 employees. Each year, the foundation awards approximately $27,000 in grants to teachers across the district.

The available grants offer various funding opportunities, including the _Excellence in Education_ grant of up to $3,500, which prioritizes projects involving community engagement, and the _Student Enrichment_ grant of up to $1,500, supporting a range of initiatives within schools. Special Opportunity Grants are also available, such as the _Allen G. Wheeler Grant_ for history and geography, and the _Mary (Pat) Noel Science Grant_, which provides up to $10,000 for large-scale science projects, particularly in physics and chemistry.

Last year, East High teachers who received these prestigious grants included Kati Lovett, Steve Knox, Sarah Evans, Nicole Cameron, Megan John, Kayla Pearson, and Colby Harrison. Their projects enriched the educational experience for students and reflected the schoolâ€™s commitment to academic excellence.

The Cheyenne Schools Foundation continues to make a significant impact on local education by supporting innovative projects that enhance the learning environment for students at East High and beyond. Stay tuned for updates on who receives grants this year!
