The Cheyenne East Thunderbirds kicked off the 2024 football season in style, securing a decisive 37-6 victory over the Laramie Plainsmen on opening night of 4A football. With a new-look roster, the T-Birds have shown that their winning ways remain intact, thanks to stellar performances from their key players.

East’s new running back, Keyshawn Brown, wasted no time making his presence known, rushing for 157 yards and finding the end zone for a touchdown. Complementing Brown’s breakout night was fellow running back Anthony Pacheco, who racked up 100 rushing yards and added two touchdowns of his own. Quarterback Nolan Horton contributed both through the air and on the ground, throwing for 114 yards, rushing for a touchdown, and even adding a field goal to cap off the night for the Thunderbirds.

While the Plainsmen struggled to find offensive consistency, quarterback Fisher Frude was able to score a rushing touchdown, and receiver Max Alexander put up an impressive 111 receiving yards on 7 catches. Despite Laramie’s efforts, they continue to search for their first winning season since 2000.
