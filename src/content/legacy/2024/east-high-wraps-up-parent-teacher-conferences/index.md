East High School recently hosted its Parent-Teacher Conferences on Thursday, October 10th, from 4 PM to 8 PM, and Friday, October 11th, from 7:15 AM to 10:45 AM. These conferences provided a valuable opportunity for parents and guardians to meet with teachers and discuss their student’s performance during the first quarter of the school year.

The focus of the meetings included grades, attendance, and behavior, offering parents insight into how their students are adjusting to the new academic year. These discussions allowed teachers to highlight student strengths, address areas of concern, and outline ways to support academic growth both at home and in the classroom. Many parents appreciated the personalized feedback and the chance to collaborate on action plans that could help their students succeed throughout the year.

In addition to discussing academic performance, teachers shared insights into classroom behavior and engagement, giving parents a clearer picture of their child’s learning habits and social interactions. This information plays a crucial role in helping students develop good study practices, time management skills, and positive classroom participation, all of which contribute to long-term success.

For students who may need additional support, EHS Time is available every morning from 7:15 AM to 7:40 AM for academic assistance from all teachers. This time is designed to provide students with extra help, whether they need tutoring, help catching up on assignments, or guidance on how to improve their grades. Additionally, East High offers Extended Day services through the Thunderbird Academy after school, providing further opportunities for students to receive academic support and participate in structured activities.

The conference format also gave parents the chance to ask questions and raise concerns, creating a two-way dialogue that strengthens the relationship between home and school. Teachers emphasized the importance of regular communication throughout the school year and encouraged parents to reach out whenever they have questions or concerns.

Thank you to all the parents and guardians who took the time to attend. Your involvement in these conferences helps build a supportive network around each student, ensuring that they have the resources they need to thrive academically and socially. We look forward to continuing to work together in the coming months to support student success!
