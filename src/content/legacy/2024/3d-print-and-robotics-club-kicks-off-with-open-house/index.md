On Wednesday, October 9th, 2024, the East High School 3D Print and Robotics Club hosted an open house, welcoming students curious about technology and creativity. Held in Mr. Harrison’s classroom, room 508, the event showcased a variety of student-made projects and innovative tools, drawing in a crowd of 10 to 15 attendees.

Visitors got a firsthand look at 3D printed keychains, intricate robotics parts, and custom figurines—all designed and printed by club members. Additionally, the club demonstrated its Raspberry Pi arcade system, allowing guests to try their hand at retro-style games. The use of Tinkercad software was also highlighted, showing how students design 3D models, along with handheld devices powered by Microsoft MakeCode, a platform for coding interactive projects.

Attendees enjoyed refreshments of cookies, soda, and water as they explored the displays and learned more about the club's projects and future plans.

Mr. Harrison, the club sponsor, emphasized that the 3D Print and Robotics Club is a great space for students to experiment with technology and turn their creative ideas into reality. The club will meet every Wednesday from 3 PM to 4 PM, offering students a regular opportunity to collaborate on new projects, from 3D printing to robotics and programming.

If you're interested in hands-on learning with cutting-edge tech, stop by next Wednesday at 3 PM in Room 508!
