Get Ready for the Wrestling Season!

The excitement is building as our school’s wrestling season kicks off on November 25! With the team working hard to prepare, this season promises to be full of fierce competition, athleticism, and school spirit. Wrestlers and coaches have been training rigorously to bring their best to the mat, focusing on strength, agility, and strategy.

For those new to wrestling, each match involves intense physical and mental challenges, where wrestlers aim to outmaneuver and outscore their opponents. It’s a sport that requires dedication and grit, and our team is ready to showcase their skills.

The season opener will be a great opportunity for students, families, and faculty to come out and show their support. Whether you’re a wrestling veteran or new to the sport, come cheer for our team as they take on their first competitors! Go team!

Stay tuned for updates on match schedules, team highlights, and ways to support our wrestlers throughout the season.
