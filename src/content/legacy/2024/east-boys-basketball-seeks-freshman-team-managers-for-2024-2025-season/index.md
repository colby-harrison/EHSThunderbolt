The East Boys' Basketball program is looking for dedicated freshman team managers to join for the 2024-2025 season. This is a fantastic opportunity to work closely with the freshman A and B basketball teams under the guidance of Coach Will and Coach Simmons. Managers play an essential role in the success of the team, handling game preparations, assisting with practice needs, and supporting players and coaches throughout the season.

To qualify, applicants should have decent to good grades, maintain strong attendance, and be prepared to commit to the entire season. If you’re organized, responsible, and eager to be part of the team atmosphere, this could be a great role for you! Those interested should reach out to Coach Johnson in the Horizon Office, located right by the student doors.
