In an effort to improve communication between students, teachers, and parents, Cheyenne East High School has adopted the Remind app. This app has become a valuable tool for staying informed about school activities, from sports events to academic announcements. By using Remind, teachers and staff can quickly send out messages, updates, and reminders, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

The app offers features that cater to both students and parents. Students can use Remind to message teachers directly, asking questions or seeking clarification on assignments and class materials. This function fosters a supportive learning environment where students can easily access the help they need.

Parents, on the other hand, gain a direct line to their child’s school community. They receive notifications about school events, game schedules, and any sudden changes, ensuring they’re always aware of what’s happening.

Teachers and coaches find Remind especially useful for organizing events and notifying groups without the need for group texts or emails. It allows them to communicate effectively with their students and team members, keeping everyone updated with real-time notifications.

With its range of functions and ease of use, Remind is quickly becoming an essential part of Cheyenne East High School’s communication toolkit.
