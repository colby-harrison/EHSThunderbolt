The annual golf banquet was held recently at the Cheyenne Airport Golf Course, where Coach Todd Oswald praised both the girls and boys varsity teams for their dedication and impressive performances this season.

"Our girls varsity letter winners worked hard and accomplished so much," Coach Oswald said. "A true highlight was having a girls team compete and qualify for state. Three out of four will be back next year, and weâ€™re super excited. We'll miss Jaimee and her leadership for sure."

The boys team also had an outstanding season, finishing third at state. Coach Oswald highlighted the contributions of seniors Nash and Daniel, who will be missed for both their leadership and their consistently low scores. "Pretty nice to constantly have two scores in the low 70s," Oswald noted. Despite their departure, the future looks bright with four returning players ready to push for another state title in 2025.

Coach Oswald expressed his pride in all the athletes, acknowledging their hard work and commitment throughout the season.
