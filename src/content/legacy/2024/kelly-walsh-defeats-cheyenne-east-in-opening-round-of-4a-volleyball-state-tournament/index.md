Cheyenne East faced an uphill battle in its opening match at the Wyoming Class 4A state volleyball tournament in Casper WY, falling in straight sets to top-seeded Kelly Walsh, 25-13, 25-14, 25-19. Despite an early push, the Thunderbirds struggled with 25 attack errors, which ultimately sealed their fate against a consistent and athletic Trojans squad.

East coach Nicole Quigley noted Kelly Walsh’s ability to stay composed and attack relentlessly, and while the T-Birds showed moments of resilience, their errors were too costly to overcome. Senior Aleah Brooks led East with seven kills, but the team’s offense couldn’t keep pace with the Trojans’ strong defense and scoring runs.

The loss drops East to the consolation bracket, where they’ll face Star Valley at 1 p.m. Friday, with hopes of continuing their tournament run.
