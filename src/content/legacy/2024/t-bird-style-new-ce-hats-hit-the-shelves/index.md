East High School is taking its school spirit to a whole new level with a fresh line of black and white hats featuring the new CE logos. Known for its creative hat designs, East High stands out among local schools, with Central focusing on shirts and South on embroidery.

This project is entirely student-led, with Sarah Marotz, Maycee Hastings, Noah Jackson, Makayla Trippel, Jesse Kirkbride, and Natalie Moore spearheading the design and production process under the guidance of Mr. Garcia. The team has worked tirelessly to ensure these hats reflect both school pride and top-notch craftsmanship.

These stylish hats are available for $15 during the first hour of each school day in the T-Bird Store. But act fast—supplies are limited!

The team isn’t stopping here. They’re already brainstorming new designs and are eager to collaborate with any Cheyenne East club looking for custom gear. If your group needs help with merchandise, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s show our T-Bird pride in style!
