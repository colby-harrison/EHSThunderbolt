The Art Club is back in action, supporting the school's football games by running the concession stand. We use this opportunity to raise money for our trips to art installations and cultural experiences. Our next big fundraiser will be during the football game on **October 11th at 5 PM**, and we're calling on all Art Club members to help out! If you're available, please Talk to Ms. Pearson to lend a hand—your support is crucial to making our fundraising efforts a success.

In addition to helping with the game, we're also excited to announce our **Pumpkin Painting Event** on **October 15th**! This event will take place in the school lobby and lunchroom and is open to all Art Club members, their siblings, and parents. It's a fantastic chance to get creative and enjoy some seasonal fun together. We’ll wrap up art club early at **4:30 PM** to allow time for cleanup and set up of the pumpkins, so be sure to come ready to paint and have a great time. Each Art club member gets two pumpkins for both them and the family members you bring, if you want more pumpkins to paint and decorate, please bring your own.

Both of these events are overseen by our amazing Art Club advisor, **Ms. Pearson**, who is dedicated to making our club activities both fun and enriching. We hope to see everyone at these events, whether you're volunteering or participating!

Also, in other news, Art Club will not be held on **November 26th**, this is because that week has only two days before break.

Let’s continue to make Art Club great—through art, fundraising, and community!
