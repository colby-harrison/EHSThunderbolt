The Cheyenne East Thunderbirds, who have been a force to be reckoned with in Wyoming high school football for the past several years, came up just short in their quest for the 4A State Championship, falling 21-0 to the Sheridan Broncs. Despite the loss, the T-Birds’ incredible resilience and determination throughout the season cannot be overlooked, as they finished the year with an impressive 9-3 record and secured their eighth consecutive winning campaign.

In what was a hard-fought battle, both teams' defenses were stellar, holding the opposing offenses to season lows in scoring. The game, however, was decided by a few critical moments that didn’t fall East's way. Sheridan managed to take advantage of two big plays in the second quarter—a pair of 80-yard touchdown receptions from Breck Reed to quarterback Ty Gilbertson. These explosive plays were the difference, but they don’t tell the full story of the T-Birds' effort.

Cheyenne East's offense, led by the playmaking abilities of Keyshawn Brown and Nolan Horton, fought valiantly throughout the game. Brown, who rushed for 55 yards, and Horton, who added 41 more, kept the Sheridan defense on their toes. However, despite a solid ground game, East struggled to find consistency in the air, with just 104 yards passing on the night. In addition, the T-Birds were hurt by three costly fumbles—turnovers that allowed Sheridan to capitalize and keep East from getting into a rhythm.

While the Broncs’ offense did manage to put up 21 points, it was not without the Thunderbirds’ defensive resistance. East held their ground, limiting the damage after each score. Sheridan’s 156 yards rushing and 189 yards passing weren’t enough to fully dominate the game, as the T-Birds’ defense continued to play tough, especially in the red zone.

Cheyenne East’s 2024 season was nothing short of exceptional, despite the disappointing result in the championship game. For the third straight year, the T-Birds met their rivals in the state final, and though they were unable to overcome Sheridan this time, the team’s grit and heart were evident throughout the game. Their defense stood tall under pressure, and the offense, led by their talented backfield, kept battling to the very end.

As Sheridan celebrates their fourth consecutive state title, Cheyenne East’s season can still be looked at as a remarkable achievement. The T-Birds have built a football program that’s consistently among the best in Wyoming, and their 9-3 record only adds to a legacy of success that has seen them achieve 8 straight winning seasons and 13 winning seasons in the last 14 years.

The T-Birds’ future remains bright, as they continue to build upon a foundation of excellence. With the leadership of head coach Chad Goff and a strong roster of returning talent, Cheyenne East will no doubt be back stronger next season, ready to make another championship run.
