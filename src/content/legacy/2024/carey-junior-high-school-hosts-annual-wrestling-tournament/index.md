Carey Junior High School is gearing up for its highly anticipated annual wrestling tournament, where young athletes from all over the region will gather to showcase their skills and determination on the mat. This year’s tournament promises to be an exciting event filled with intense matchups and incredible sportsmanship, and Carey’s wrestling program is looking to the community for support in making it a smooth, memorable experience.

Scheduled for October 26th, the tournament will feature several weight classes, with athletes ranging from beginner to advanced levels. For many of the young wrestlers, it’s a chance to gain competition experience and test their skills against their peers. The Carey Junior High coaching staff has been working hard to prepare the team and ensure the event meets the standards that families, athletes, and fans have come to expect.

To successfully manage an event of this size, Carey Junior High is asking for volunteers to help with various tasks such as setting up mats, scorekeeping, concessions, and clean-up. Volunteers are also needed to help manage the registration desk, assist coaches, and guide teams to their designated areas. No previous experience is necessary, and there are roles available for people of all ages and backgrounds. Whether you're a parent, community member, or just a fan of the sport, your help would make a significant difference.

If you’re interested in supporting young athletes and being a part of this exciting event, please contact Carey Junior High School’s athletic department. Volunteering is a fantastic way to connect with the community, support local sports, and inspire the next generation of athletes.
