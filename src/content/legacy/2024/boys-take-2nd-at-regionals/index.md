For the first time since 2010, the East High School boys tennis team made an impressive showing, claiming second place at the South Regional tournament. This marks a significant milestone for the team, reflecting the dedication and determination they've put into improving their game over the past few years.

Headlining the individual performances, Colin secured an impressive 2nd place finish in his singles bracket, while Brady fought hard to claim 4th place. In doubles, Aiden and Kale showed resilience, taking 3rd place, followed by Bridger and Kaden, who finished 4th. Landon and Nolan added to the team’s success, earning 2nd place in their doubles match.

Coach Cameron praised the team’s efforts: “These boys have worked so hard to get better over the last few years, and it is great to see their hard work pay off! Their determination and growth as athletes have been incredible.”

With this strong performance, the team is now setting their sights on the state tournament in Gillette next weekend. The East boys head into the competition with strong seedings, giving them an excellent chance to make a run for the podium.

Best of luck to the team as they continue their journey at state!
