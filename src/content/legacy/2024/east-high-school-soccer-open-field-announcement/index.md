Attention East High School students! We’re excited to announce that our Soccer Open Field sessions, led by head coach Alex Stratton and assistant coach Cody Fournier, will start on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. This is a fantastic opportunity for students to enhance their skills, meet new friends, and gear up for the upcoming soccer season.

Beginning October 22, Open Field sessions will take place every Tuesday from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at North Park. These sessions are open to players of all skill levels—whether you’re a seasoned athlete looking to refine your game or a newcomer eager to learn. It’s a perfect chance to improve your technique, boost your fitness, and have fun while playing the sport you love.

During each session, players will engage in a variety of drills focused on skill development, including dribbling, passing, shooting, and defensive strategies. Coaches Stratton and Fournier will provide guidance and feedback to help participants grow both individually and as part of a team. This collaborative environment encourages players to challenge themselves and support one another.

In addition to skill-building, Open Field is a great way to foster teamwork and camaraderie among students. Whether you’re bonding over a friendly match or sharing tips and tricks, the connections you make on the field can last a lifetime.

Mark your calendars and prepare for some exciting soccer action! Don’t forget to bring your cleats, water bottle, and plenty of enthusiasm. We encourage everyone to come out and make the most of this opportunity. Let’s make this season unforgettable and kick off the year with energy and passion for the game! We can’t wait to see all of you at North Park!
