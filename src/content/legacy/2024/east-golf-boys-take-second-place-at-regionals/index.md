The Cheyenne East boys golf team narrowly missed out on the 4A conference title, finishing just one stroke behind the champions to claim second place at regionals. Despite the close margin, the Thunderbirds are determined to make a strong run at defending their state title next week.

Leading the way for East was Nash Coleman, who captured the individual conference championship with two impressive rounds of 71. Daniel also had a standout performance, finishing in second place with scores of 69 and 75. Thayne, Bryce, and Abe rounded out the team effort with rounds of 80, 82, and 85, respectively. On the JV side, Devon shot an 85, and Lander carded an 87.

Coach Hartigan expressed confidence in the team heading into the state tournament in Star Valley, saying, “We fell just short today, but we’ll be ready to bring home that big trophy next week.”

The East boys golf team will now set their sights on defending their state title at the upcoming Wyoming Class 4A State Golf Tournament.
