Starting October 8th, East High School will be hosting Open Mat sessions for students interested in wrestling. These sessions will be held every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 6:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m., giving students an excellent opportunity to get extra practice, improve their skills, and prepare for the upcoming wrestling season.

Open Mat is a great way for wrestlers of all levels to work on techniques, conditioning, and drills in a more relaxed setting. Coaches will be on hand to offer guidance, but the sessions will be largely self-directed, allowing students to focus on areas they want to improve. Whether you're new to wrestling or a seasoned competitor, Open Mat provides a valuable chance to develop skills in a supportive environment.

This program is open to all East High students who are interested in wrestling, whether they are on the school team or simply curious about the sport. For those looking to join the wrestling team, Open Mat sessions offer a preview of what practices are like and a chance to get a head start on training. Sessions will take place in the wrestling room, so students are encouraged to bring their wrestling gear and plenty of water.

For more information or questions about the Open Mat sessions, students are encouraged to reach out to the East High School wrestling coach. Get ready to hit the mat and make the most of this fantastic opportunity to build strength, agility, and camaraderie!
