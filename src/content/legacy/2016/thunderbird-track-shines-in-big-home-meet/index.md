There's something to be said about track athletes and their fans. To be successful at track, an athlete needs to have patience, commitment and resilience - patience in earning a win, commitment to put in the time, and the resilience to bounce back from adversity and tragedy. Like the athlete, the fan of track and field also requires those same traits - the patience to sit in the stands for hours on end, the commitment to support a runner through wind and snow, and the resilience to watch a favorite son or daughter stumble and fall time and time again. Track athletes and their fans are a special kind of tough.

The Thunderbirds hosted the Okie Blanchard Invite, one of the biggest meets of the year, in early April. The EHS girls set the tone early by keeping the girls' championship in the Thunderbird trophy case.
