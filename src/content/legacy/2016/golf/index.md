Mariah Farden has been consistently one of East’s best golfers over the past few years. She continued that trend at the Torrington Invite on Friday, May 7. At that tournament, Farden once again led the field, shooting a 6-over-par to take the win, while teammate Logan Kasten split third place with Jo Maillot from Douglas.

“I think our biggest competition is probably Sheridan,” said the senior golfer. “Their team and their individual players are really good.”

The boys were led by Ben Cole and his fourth place finish. Cole scored an 81. Not far behind was teammate Blake Danni, who split fifth place with Central High School’s Brendan Cobb, after they both shot an 82.

Finishing off at the Torrington Invite lead the Thunderbirds into the conference meet, on May 16 and 17, in Cheyenne, at the Airport Golf Course.

“Hopefully I’ll do well at conference,” said Mariah. “I’ve been preparing a lot for it. I think my team will do really well actually. We won last week.”
