Online dating has become huge for people who can’t find love in their own area or people who just lack the experience of dating in general. Soon, there will be so many people meeting online that parents will have to tell their children that they first met over the soft glow of a laptop monitor and the gentle clicking of the “send” key.

According to a _Pewresearch_ article, here are some interesting facts about online dating. A majority of Americans say that online dating is a good way to meet people. Online dating has jumped by 17% since 2013 among adults under age 25, and usage by those in their late 50s and early 60s has jumped by 6%. With all its popularity, one-third of people who have used online dating have never actually gone on a date with someone they met on those sites. Maybe as an indication of their struggles to find a date, one in five online daters have asked someone else to help them with their profile. As of today, about 5% of Americans who are married or in a committed relationship say they met their significant other online.

Even though many people would like to find a date in person, there are many reasons why they can’t. According to a _Marie Claire_ article by Rich Santos, one reason is the lack of time. People join dating sites because they are tired of trying to find people. It takes time to plan, seek out, and pursue a date. Too many of us are so busy in our everyday lives, we can’t take time for the chase. Another reason is that they want to be in a “singles environment.” Instead of trying to find out if their crush likes them or not, they date online so the people they talk to don’t mind if they get hit on or not. Everyone is there for the same reason. Another factor is it takes too much effort to find someone interesting. Others are only seeking sexual relationships. Others fear they lack “the game” to survive the face-to-face pursuit.

Of course, one of the biggest risks of online dating is trust. Many people try to find someone online, but that person might not be who they say they are. Being “catfished” creates justifiable fear in those seeking dates. Catfishing is pretending to be someone you’re not using social media in order to pursue deceptive online romances. People catfish others for many reasons. Some reasons may be because they’re insecure and have a low self-esteem, or they have been hurt themselves and want other people to hurt as well, or they're so bored with their own lives that they feel a need to mess with people. Online dating could be a good way to find someone, but be careful because if they’re not who they say they are, they might find a way to hurt you.

Online dating is a great way to meet people because dating sites give greater options to people with the same interests. With online dating, you don’t have to depend on family and friends to embarrass you with a complete stranger in public. Older people can join dating sites and seek out others in same age range and try to avoid wthe bar scene. Online dating is also easy because most people have easy access to the internet. Where are you going to meet the love of your life?
