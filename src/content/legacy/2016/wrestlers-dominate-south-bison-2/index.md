On one of the biggest nights of the year, Senior Night, the Thunderbird wrestling team took advantage of seven T-Bird pins to dominate South High School, 58-18. After a sluggish start, and the T-Birds only leading the match 22-18 after seven matches, the East team rallied with five pins to pull away.

"(Our wrestlers) did really well," said assistant coach Charles Fournier. "They fought hard. We have things to work on, but they did a good job of getting at it and staying offensive."

Jacob Fogg (182 pounds), Kevin Doughty (220), Shawn Smith (113), Bryton Winchell (120), Trenton Eldridge (152), Gunner Bartlett (145) and Steven Lahnert (152) all won by pin.

Seth Green (160) took a major decision, while Tommy Neal and Kaleb Dooley won by decision.

The night kicked off with ten junior varsity matches, and the East JV wrestlers set the tone for the evening.

"It's hard to say individual folks did better than others," continued coach Fournier. "A match that stuck out was Daniel Grube. He did a really good job of getting after it. Hunter Bohn also did a really good job of going out and making progress in his work."

Recognized for their Senior season: Bailey Rumpf (manager), Hunter Bohn, Kaleb Dooley, Kevin Doughty, Trenton Eldridge, Steven Lahnert, and Tyler Shaw.
