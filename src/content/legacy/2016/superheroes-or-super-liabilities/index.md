Who says the ultimate power needs to be the ultimate good? Just because there is power doesn't mean there is heroics. Batman Vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice brings the fear of power to the light. Betrayal from hero to hero, with the determination of vengeance causing the question of the true ability of heroism.

Bat, Alien, and the end of the world. Batman Vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice pits two of the icons of DC Comics against each other in a seemingly endless battle of hatred.

Batman and Superman spend most of this movie trying to mark their territory over one another, disapproving of the style of the other one and believing the other one isn't needed. The eventual conflict comes in a short and overly dramatic fight that lasts too little time for the namesake of the movie.

Though the characterization of both Batman and Superman was underrated and filled with nothing but anger and testosterone, not everything the movie portrayed was bad. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) created a character that was both intriguing as a take on the classic character and taken to a new level with the darker version of DC films that have been on the rise. With Lex being the genius with an insane side. He learns to manipulate both the Bat and Superman in the scariest ways and pit them against each other for his own benefit. The guest appearance of Wonder Woman gives a bigger range of DC fans some interest to go and see the movie.

Similar to classic Marvel tradition, DC previewed future movies in the middle of Batman VS. Superman. The previews and hints of future franchise movies were poorly placed, forced and were even unnecessary to most fans. Put in a different part of the film these moments might have come across a lot more of an exciting moment for the future of DC. In their attempt to pull off a marvel movie tradition with their own spin they wasted valuable time they could have used to create depth in what turns out to be a fairly 2D storyline..

For a movie that spent most of itâ€™s time in testosterone-filled stares and dramatic backstories, the movie overall was 2D and easy to predict. The acting was fair to good for most actors, but the writing and timeline needed work, giving the movie a decent result as a whole.
