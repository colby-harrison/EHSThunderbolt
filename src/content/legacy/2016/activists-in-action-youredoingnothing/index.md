You get home from a long day at work, flop down on the couch and turn on the T.V. CNN pops to life with pictures of mangled, bloody bodies littering some Middle Eastern street. Disgusted, you flip to FOX and there is a video of a woman grieving of her disembodied child. Now it’s MSNBC and a battered toddler is wailing for her parents that will never come. You get bored. You’d rather watch a re-run of “Friends.”

Terrorism is a huge global problem. According to the US State department, terrorism deaths nearly tripled from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were a reported 18,000 deaths amid nearly 10,000 terror acts. But in 2014, nearly 33,000 people were killed in about 13,500 terror attacks across the world, that’s nearly 40 incidents a day.

So why do we change the channel if terrorism is growing? This may be because these acts happen too often. We’ve become immune, we’ve become too detached, and we forget those are people. We think of them as pictures on a TV screen. This doesn’t mean we aren’t upset, but it means that out first reaction after a terrorism incident is to create a tweet with the hashtag “Prayfor\*insert city name here\*,” and rejoice in our contributions to the cause. We foolishly believe that our "likes" stop bullets from coming out of barrels in the Middle East.

Don’t get me wrong, I support unity. I support us finding common ground. It’s important to come together. Although, if the extent of your actions is to quickly turn on your phone and hastily create a Facebook post for “awareness,” then you are doing nothing. Everyone is fully aware of bullying, AIDS, cancer, terrorism and all the rest of the world's ills. Thank you very much.

The next step is to do something about it, to actually get from behind your keyboard, your safety blanket, and help solve the problem. Like the saying goes, if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. For example, a good portion of Americans support troops going into the Middle East and attacking ISIS, although many wouldn’t actually go to the Middle East to do it.

So what could we do to get involved? You could actually go to the Middle East and help the victims. Or, if you don’t have time for that, you could donate or start a campaign. Anything that actually does something.

If we all put down our keyboards, iPhones, tablets, and laptops, roll up are sleeves or just donate money, we could make the world a whole lot better of a place. If we pay attention to our global community, instead of isolating ourselves with Words with Friends, we can really make a difference. So join me to #DoActualGood.
