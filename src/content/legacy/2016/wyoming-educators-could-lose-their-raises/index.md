The teachers in the state of Wyoming that received pay raises in 2015 might be losing their raises because of budget cuts in 2016. The $6 million spent on teachers raises that were provided across 2015 might be needed to be cut for the 2017-2018 biennium, according to Kari Eakins, communications director for the Wyoming Department of Education in a wyomingnews.com article.

The Legislature provided $6 million in external cost adjustment in 2013-2014 to pay for teachers raises. This cost adjustment  wasn’t included in the 2017-2018 two year schedule. If funding isn’t found for the raises then teachers may be dropped back down to their salaries from the 2013-2014 biennium.

"What happened was the Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration thought that the external cost adjustment was part of the bill that they voted on back in August, and they found out a few days later that it is not a part of the bill," said Sen. Jeff Wasserburger when interviewed by the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle about the situation.

The situation could very well cause a lot of controversy between teachers and the state. The problem also has the possibility of being fixed before it really becomes a big issue.

Upcoming meetings may shed more light on the situation when legislators will look at funding and vote to approve old wages or see what they can do to keep up the funding for the future. Legislative sessions start on February 8.
