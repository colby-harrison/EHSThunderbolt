It’s been a long day - bouncing between classes, learning new concepts, taking tests. A long day like this can take a lot out of you. Late night practices, early morning quizzes. Sometimes it seems as if there’s just not enough hours in the day. A worn out mind and a sore body. Being so involved can take its toll, but the rewards make it all worth it. Senior Elizabeth Kassel’s typical day is the epitome of this crazy life.

Higher-level academics are just the tip of the iceberg of activities that this involved 18-year-old decided to take on during her senior year of high school, many of which started long before her high school career even began.

Beginning her freshman year, Elizabeth decided to take on the challenge of the International Baccalaureate program, sticking with the program’s courses into her senior year. While many students can be discouraged by the IB workload, she is involved in the Cheyenne girl’s Capital hockey team, dances hip hop at the En Avant dance studio, volunteers at the Governor’s Mansion and is part of the Cheyenne ice skating group. With so many extracurricular activities on top of her school workload, you have to think to yourself _how does she do it?_

“I usually just stick to a schedule,” said Elizabeth. “I do school, go to skating, come home, eat dinner, do some homework and then do my night activities, which is usually hockey or dance. There’s always too much to do and so little time of the day. Since it was my senior year, it got a little overwhelming.”

The most prominent and consistent activity this busy bee takes part in is the graceful sport of competitive figure skating. The first time on ice turned out to be a miserable day, but when she skated off, she knew it was the sport for her. For a little more than eleven years, Elizabeth has learned, fallen, performed and improved.

“I remember my friend, Megan, took me skating and it was freezing cold and I was absolutely miserable. I had like, two pairs of gloves on and hats and several coats on, and we were skating around and when it was time to get off, I got off the ice and looked at my mom and I was like ‘Mom, I want to do skating’.”

While the cold and misery of her first experience on the ice could have easily chased her away, Elizabeth couldn’t deny her excitement for her new sport. She decided to tough it out, and she ended up finding the sport that taught her self-discipline and perseverance. Skating has given her the strength and the ability to overcome her daily challenges.

“Mentally, when I don’t want to do things, I have to find ways to make it entertaining for myself. I have to make a little game out of it. It helped me get the Congressional Award, bronze and silver this year because I accomplished a goal I set out through figure skating.”

The Congressional Award is to recognize outstanding students who have shown initiative in their communities and their selves to better the world around them

Being heavily involved in both academics and in extracurricular activities has proved that Elizabeth has the persistence and the drive to take her places that many others may never go. Her involvement as a figure skater has given her both a personal sense of achievement as well as recognition as a bronze and silver Congressional Award medalist.
