Trophies can’t be hoisted in front of hundreds or thousands without first putting in work in the view of only a few, if not all alone. Banners wouldn’t hang in gyms for fans to see if not for the blood, sweat and tears shed when the stands were empty. Those are the firm beliefs held by Cheyenne East junior Cosette Stellern. Sports are all she’s ever known, and they’re what she’s dedicated her life to.

What is a seasonal activity for some has become a year-round dedication for Stellern in her quest for greatness. She’s learned to fall in love with the grind, and it has paid its dividends. Stellern’s junior campaign at Cheyenne East was nothing short of stellar, stockpiling a list of accolades in one school year that rivals the body of work most athletes put together throughout their entire prep careers.

In volleyball, Stellern was a repeat Class 4A all-state selection as well as the recipient of Wyoming’s 2015 Gatorade Player of the Year for the second year in a row. She set school hitting and kills percentage records in leading East to a 33-1 overall record and second-consecutive 4A state title. Stellern was also named a 2015 All-American by PrepVolleyball.com, the first to do so from Cheyenne and only the third ever from Wyoming. In addition, she was one of five finalists for the National Junior Class Player of the Year by the same website.

In basketball, Stellern was once again a repeat all-state selection for the Lady Thunderbirds and helped lead the team to a third-place finish at the state tournament with her 13 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.5 steals, 1.5 assists and 1 block per game averages. Her rebounding mark led all of 4A as she surpassed East’s career rebounding record, which now stands at 472 – a mark that will surely grow, possibly to the point of being insurmountable.

In track and field, Stellern won her first state titles in both shot put and discus with throws of 41 feet, 6¾ inches and 135-4, respectively. She also had the furthest throw in shot put in any class this season, as well as the second-furthest in all classes in discus. It’s no surprise then as to why Stellern is a unanimous selection as the repeat female Prep Athlete of the Year as chosen by the WyoSports staff – another addition to her already extensive list of personal awards.

While others put together résumés worth noting, that of Stellern’s was the clear-cut favorite.

“She has a lot of natural ability, but where she sets herself apart is with her work ethic,” East volleyball coach Dan Box said of Stellern. “She’d already be a great athlete on ability alone, but she outworks everyone. She’s second to none when it comes to that.

“She works so hard to put herself in a position to be successful in whatever she chooses to do.”

Box has been at East for 17 years and is in his third stint as the coach of the volleyball team. And during his tenure, he’s had many great athletes come through the program. The proof is easy to see, as East has produced four of the past six Gatorade Player of the Year winners – Stellern taking the honors the past two seasons, along with Sally Sanders in 2012 and Meghan Sipe in 2010.

Stellern is simply the next in line to continue the tradition of excellence that began before she ever suited up for the T-Birds and will likely continue after she no longer frequents East’s hallways. What resonates with Box is her want – and ability – to dominate whichever sport she competes in.

East girls basketball coach Rusty Horsley shared the same sentiment.

“I don’t think people realize just how hard Cosette works. In the summer she’s in the gym every day, she’s in the weight room working every day. It takes a lot just to be that successful in one sport, but for three? It takes that much more dedication and time,” Horsley said. “You put academics on top of that – and everything she’s trying to accomplish in her life – and it’s even more impressive to see her achieve all that she has.”

Added Box: “To have that passion and desire to be the best is rare, and she spreads it out over three sports.

“It sure is something special to see.”

Make no mistake, it is an everyday grind for Stellern. Her day begins with volleyball, followed by basketball and weightlifting. Then she heads out to the throwing ring for shot put and discus work. From 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, all summer long – that’s her schedule.

Why put herself through that? Why give up her summer vacation? Just ask Stellern. She’ll tell you why.

“I don’t like losing at all. I hate losing. So I work really hard not to lose,” Stellern said with a contagious laugh.

So while most all of the other high school-aged kids are out trying to make the most of summer vacation, Stellern remains low-key – opting to stay away from the hustle and bustle and any potential distractions. Instead, she’s making the most of her free time by spending it the only way she knows how: on the hardwood, in the throwing ring and in the weight room – her own preferred type of the aforementioned hustle and bustle. Stellern’s determined to be successful no matter the sport, even if it comes at the expense of her social life.

“It sucks getting up early, working hard and all that – it sucks. But getting that payoff with your team and just knowing what I did helped me and helped my teammates … it’s totally, definitely worth it,” Stellern said. “When you win a state championship, you just cry. It’s just so emotional because you know all your hard work you put in shows and it’s there.”
