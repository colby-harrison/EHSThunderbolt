In the US we are dealing with unfair trade, overpriced healthcare, universal terrorism, and much more, but President-elect Trump has a plan for everything.  President-elect Donald Trump has stated that he will make America great again by proposing new ideas about trade deals, unemployment, illegal immigration, universal healthcare, and ISIS.

In his seven-point plan for trade he wants to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China in order to bring America back on top.

Trump said that he wants to negotiate fair trade deals that will create American jobs. "Our country is in serious trouble," Trump said on MSNBC. "We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say China, in a trade deal? I beat China all the time. All the time. When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions. And what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist folks. They beat us all the time."

His plan is to place tariffs on foreign goods, making American merchandise cheaper when in comparison. Although a president can’t levy tariffs without congressional approval, he may be able to convince the Republican Party leaders despite their opinions on free trade.

One of Trumps plans to decrease unemployment is to bring jobs back to America from foreign countries.

“I'm going to bring jobs back from China, Mexico, Japan, and Vietnam. They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We're going to bring that money back” he said.

The official U.S. unemployment rate for November is 4.9%, according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Although this doesn’t seem like a lot, the unemployment rate hasn’t changed since the great recession. New jobs in America would help our overwhelming debt and many families struggling to survive without a solid income.

Immigration has been a hot topic lately and Trump has some serious ideas to deal with this problem. He wants to build a fence. Deploy 25,000 additional border agents in order to enforce immigration control, and shut down all detention centers as well as end the DREAM act.

The DREAM Act is an American legislative proposal for a multi-phase process for undocumented immigrants in the United States that would first grant conditional residency and upon meeting further qualifications, permanent residency.

Trumps plans for healthcare include repealing the Affordable Care Act so that no American is forced to have insurance. He is pushing for a review of Medicaid options to make sure everyone who wants or needs healthcare is able to afford it.

He also said he will establish tax-free Health Savings Accounts. The accounts could become part of one’s estate and passed on to their children without an estate penalty.

While we as American’s are facing unfortunate circumstances, which could be detrimental to the next generation, Donald trump is the newly elected president and has a plan to make America great again.
