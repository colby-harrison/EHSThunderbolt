Hunted by an empire that controls half the galaxy, stranded in a desert of shifting sands, but there’s a town over the next dune, or maybe the next, or the next. All without the pilot he’d saved only to lose in the infinite shifting sands. The mutinous storm trooper, Finn, trudged through the sand desperate for water and a small droid that he had lost his first and only friend for.

Finn finally made it to the small town and upon reaching his destination he desperately looked for water, and found some in a water trough for the work animals. He was gulping down the repulsive water when he saw it; The droid he’d been looking for, next to a girl. Before he could blink, she was jumped and he sprinted to help, but before he got half way there, she had taken both adversaries out and then looked his way and attacked.

Ray the main character, was left on the planet by her family. She had been scavenging parts and metal off of the remnants of destroyed starships and walkers and selling them for food; that is, until the storm trooper came. She was on her way home when a couple of thugs tried to steal the droid she had found. She had just taken care of them when she saw him standing there, wearing a jacket that didn’t belong to him and went to reclaim it.

After thirty years of peace since the empire was defeated, the new order has arisen to take its place. The scavenger and the rogue Storm trooper must play their parts in this new battle of good vs. evil. Both Ray and Finn must fight of the first order while trying to find the lost Luke Skywalker in a journey that will bring back old friends and introduce new ones.

This movie is very reminiscent of the plot of the previous movies with an epic battle between a rampaging evil and a force savvy castaway who falls in love with the most unlikely person possible. Despite the recycled plot, the videography and computer graphics were spectacular. The story kept you on the edge of your seat, even though it was painfully predictable.
