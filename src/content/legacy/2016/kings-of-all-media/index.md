When you watch the evening news, skim the daily newspaper or even crank up the radio, you don’t realize the magic it takes to bring you today’s news.

In late April, the Thunderbolt newspaper staff took the opportunity to stop by several local media outlets to check out their operations.

Listening in on the KFBC radio station, reading the columns at the Wyoming Tribune Eagle newspaper and watching a live broadcast at the CBS News Channel 5 station opened the eyes of the staff to the world of journalism.

“It was really cool to see how everything works behind the scenes as someone who wants to go into journalism,” says junior Evie Brady. “Watching the news broadcast behind the scenes was the most interesting because you see it from a whole new angle.”

From the eyes of written journalists, seeing the different branches of the market broadened their horizons for their possible journalism futures.

“For a person whose primary journalism tactics is in written form, I enjoyed seeing broadcast and radio journalism fields,” says senior Hannah Lewis. “This is something I’m looking to possibly do with my life.”
