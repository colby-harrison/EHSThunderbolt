A booming cheer floods the field as the football players scramble to the end zone. With the ball firmly gripped in one hand, each player trying to keep up with the pace, the running back eyes the goal line. The rest of his team had done what they could to give the back an opportunity to score six points. He plunges into the end zone, putting the T-Birds on top for good.

It’s Friday night and that means football at East High School. In a season of ups and downs, the Thunderbirds battled to a 4-4 regular season finish. As the 7-seed entering the playoffs, East faces Sheridan in the first round of the playoffs.

In the opening game, East traveled to Rock Springs to face one of the state’s best rushing games. Missing out on a two-point conversion, East lost the game 20-21. “We lost and felt like crap.” “Rock Springs was hard to beat,” said senior tight end Seth Green.

The following week the T Birds played the Natrona Mustangs at Okie Blanchard. East put on a show rolling the Mustangs, 30-0. East had 222 yards of rushing with four touchdowns.

On September 9, the T-birds and the Bison battled it out on South’s field. In another very physical battle, South topped East, 31-28. The game featured over 500 yards rushing.

The Thunderbirds then halted a red-hot Sheridan team. The Broncs spent most of the year ranked in the top two 4A teams in the state. The EHS offense struggled to click and the T-Birds lost, 16-21.

Next up the Trojans from Kelly Walsh. EHS dominated the game and racked up a 23-6 victory. For the sixth game of the year, East traveled across town to face the Central Indians. Seeking revenge for an upset win from last year, East rocked the Indians for 345 yards rushing and a 36-10 win.

Laramie then came back to town for the Thunderbirds homecoming game. While East won the statistics battle, the Plainsmen won the game, 21-31. For the final regular season game, East traveled across the state to face the Evanston Red Devils. For three quarters, the T-birds dominated the game, taking a 35-0 lead. Things got a little crazy as the Red Devils quickly scored 28 answered points. East did take home the win, 35-28.
