The Cheyenne East speech and debate team seized the day at the Green River Invitational, on December 11 and 12, winning the Sweepstakes by having the most team points of the tournament. At the Green River tournament, East won Sweepstakes, which means that they had more higher-scoring members than any other team.

Like any competitive arena, winning at speech and debate is often a result of attitude and hard work, and East's team is demonstrating a winning spirit.

"There are probably two things," said the Speech and Debate coach Mr. Viney. "The first thing is the excitement and energy that’s happening. You can’t win or work hard if you don’t care. (And then) there's that fundamental drive of excitement to do well. So the second thing is just how hard they work all the time."

For the next few weeks the speech and debate team is going to be working hard on trying to improve to gain more wins and for everyone to continue to grow with the help of hard work.

“The best part is the students is you just see kids grow so much, so fast," continued Mr. Viney. "At the very beginning of the year, they're nervous to speak in front of people and the all of a sudden, half way through the year, they don’t care about it at all."

Speech and Debate is a great class for students who may have a small fear of public speaking and want challenge themselves. It's also a chance to do great things with a high school career. So far this year the Speech and Debate team has done a very good job of staying on track and taking all of the in-state wins.
