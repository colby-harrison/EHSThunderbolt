The East High varsity girls' basketball team dominated Central in this year's first rivalry game. The Lady T-Birds took control early and finished off the Indians 49-42. Throughout the first three quarters of the game both teams were neck and neck. In the fourth quarter, things seemed to take a turn in Central's favor when junior Cosette Stellern was called for a technical foul. After some time on the bench though, Stellern was able to turn the game around, bringing East's lead to 45-40. Once Stellern got back in the game, the rest of the Lady T-Birds took over for the win.

The East High varsity boys' suffered a crushing loss against Central High in their rivalry game. East maintainedÂ  a commanding lead throughout the first three quarters, but in the last half of the third quarter, Central pulled ahead. Despite 16 points from senior Elijah Oliver, the T-Birds came up short, 61-53.

The first rivalry game of the season was also the basketball pink game in support of breast cancer awareness. East High has also hosted two other pink games for football and volleyball. Students that attended the game were encouraged to wear pink and the players wore pink jerseys. East High hopes that by hosting pink games they can do their part to raise breast cancer awareness in Cheyenne and across Wyoming.
