The swimmers then set their sights on the state meet in Gillette. You could say Wessenberg foresaw the results.

“We’re training pretty heavy right now,” said Wessenberg. “As a team we’re going to have a few finalists. It’s gonna be fast this year, and I know some records are gonna be broken.”

Just as Wessenberg called it, there was a Thunderbird finalist, and Jackson Mugg made sure everyone knew him.

Mugg left his mark on the East High record books and wrapped up the team’s lone state championship when he posted a 4:52.76 in the 500-yard freestyle.

“I just went out and raced,” said Mugg in an interview with wyosports.net. “I had someone right next to me pushing me. I really wanted to win. I’ve worked really hard for this.”

Mugg also reset East’s school record in the 200 freestyle with his third-place time of 1:47.18.
