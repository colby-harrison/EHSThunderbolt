The Lady Thunderbirds swim team went up to Gillette and competed at the 4A Girls State Swim and Dive Championship meet. Over the two competition days, four swimmers made consolation finals and two divers made finals. East placed 9th overall at the meet held at the Gillette Aquatic Center on October 28 and 29.

Sage Morton, a freshman, swam the 500 free, placing 8th, and the 200 free placing 9th , both in consolation finals with personal bests. Posting a 5:29.48 in her 500 free qualified her for the Western Zones meet in Fresno, California, next summer.

“I think I did really good, considering I’m a freshman,” said Morton. “I didn’t make it in finals, but I did make it into consolations, which is good.”

Senior Hannah Jankovsky swam the 200 IM and the 100 breast but didn’t make it into consolation final.

“I think this year was a lot about growth,” said Jankovsky. “It wasn’t the very best year but there were a lot of high points.”

Juniors Saige Smith, Kendrew Ellis and Mckenna Smith all swam in the 100 fly. Mckenna Smith saw the highest finish in that event, placing 8th, with a time of 1:02.55, also qualifying her for the Western Zones meet.

The divers that went to state this year were senior Lily Joslin, placing 9th with 292.30 points, and freshman Braeden Stewart, placing 12th with 270.40 points.

“I think I did really well, for it being my first year,” said Joslin.

Next year, the 2017 will be a younger team with optimism for a better team and more state qualifiers. “We will go back next year and place higher,” said coach Jamie Winkler

The Lady Thunderbirds that swam at state included: Kelly Farris, Suzi Keller, Sage Morton, Saige Smith, Makenna Smith, Kendrew Ellis, Hannah Jankovsky, and Mackenzie Hoskins. The Lady Thunderbirds divers were Braeden Stewart and Lily Joslin.
