What is Valentine’s Day? Why do we celebrate it? Well most people think it is all romance and love but it actually the death day of a martyr named St. Valentine. Most historians agree Valentine was a Roman priest, but the rest of the story is debated. Some say that he was a priest that was going against the law and married young couples and was executed, others say he was executed for helping Christians escape Rome, one where he wasn’t put to death says that he was sent to prison and sent the very first valentine to the jailers daughter. There is also another explanation given that says that valentine was just a figurehead for the church trying to Christianize a pagan festival. So when you say “will you be my valentine” realize you are saying “will you be my dead catholic priest”.

Valentine’s Day has mutated into a reason to spend money by geniuses in the business department. Every Valentine’s Day Americans spend around $15 billion every year; The only holiday that Americans spend more on is Christmas. Why is the noble death of a priest a reason to spend money for your “significant other”? Things like this happen to all our holidays companies are trying to get more money out of you by telling you to “Buy buy buy for the one you care for this holiday!”, and “great holiday deals!” the businesses pull you away from the messages of the holidays the most dramatic of them is Easter. Easter is the celebration of Christ’s resurrection so where did the chocolate bunnies and eggs hidden in the park come from. Halloween is another example of this holiday mutilation. Originally Halloween was a holiday to celebrate the dead and the life they once held but now it is candy and costumes. How did Halloween become horror houses and going door to door asking for candy: business is ripping apart our holidays and redefining them into something that the founders would roll over in their graves about. So please before you spend all your money on holiday “deals” remember what it’s all really about.
