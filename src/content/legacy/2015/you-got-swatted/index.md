The Lady T-birds have been the talk of the town these past weeks as they’ve passed, set, and hit their way through 29 games with their eyes on the prize. As of right now, the T-birds have a season of 27-1, giving them the top seed going into regionals. The volleyball team has worked hard to achieve their spot.

“We have worked together for multiple years now,” said junior Sierra Stellern. “We have team chemistry. You have to learn where they will be on the court and to trust them and to play for each other.”

Even though their season has been nearly perfect, they also have to work to improve their weaknesses to ensure they don’t lose their place due to the little things.

“We have many strengths as a team,” said sophomore Lexi Trowbridge. “We are really good at working together for serve and receive and knowing where the others are on the court. One of our weaknesses is when we get behind in points, we don’t do as well in communicating to each other and that can effect a team greatly.”

The T-birds have been challenged in many ways this season, especially against their toughest competitor.

“Gillette is probably our toughest competition this season,” said junior Natasha Heins. “They have a great volleyball team and are always competing their hardest against us.”

Though Gillette has created a tough competition for the Lady T-birds so far in the season, they still came out triumphant with a win against Gillette 3-0 on October 19.
