If you want to dance like Uma Thurman, Fall Out Boy is the band you're looking for.

The recent release of Fall Out Boy's new album, _American Beauty/American Psycho_ on January 20 brought a new and different sound, with catchy songs like "Uma Thurman" and the album titled song "American Beauty/ American Psycho". The whole album takes less of a pop/rock, pop/punk sound and more of a collection of pop songs. The change of direction may raise mixed feelings for long time fans who've been around since the release of classics like "Sugar, We're Goin' Down" or "Coffees for Closers", but as a long time fan myself, I can safely say the change works for Fall Out Boy. They know how to change their sound enough to be different, but you can still recognize the voice of Patrick Stump the second he hits the first note.

The songs "Twin Skeletons (Hotel In NYC)", "Novocaine" , and "Centuries" still have the classic Fall Out Boy sound, comforting long time fans. Both songs provide that rocky sound with an edge, and a powerful message you can belt along to with your fist in the air. The songs "4th of July" and "Irresistible" have to be my top two choices on the album, with "The Kids Aren't Alright"  following close behind. They provide a fun energy with heavy beats, whether it's a mix of electronic sounds or drums, and "The Kids Aren't Alright" provides deep lyrics anyone can relate to after a bad day. The band has used a lot more electronic sound than their past work, but it doesn't sound completely auto tuned like an old Black Eyed Peas song.

The whole album as a whole is definitely not my favorite of theirs, their older works are definitely my favorites from _Infinity on High_ to _From Under the Cork Tree_, but I definitely have no problem blasting it in the car with the windows down. I hope the band doesn't decide to completely change their sound to 100% pop, because they would lose their charm.
