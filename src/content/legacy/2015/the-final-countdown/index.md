The 2015 NCAA March Madness tournament has come to an end. March Madness is one of the biggest sporting events of the year. It seems like everyone becomes an insane fan of college basketball, even if only for a few days. The tournament gets millions of college basketball fans, and non-fans, passionate about this special event. Everyone is ready to support their favorite team at the basketball games, screaming at the television at home, and filling out their brackets for a chance to win a little money.

This year's Final Four welcomed Wisconsin, Kentucky, Duke, and Michigan State. Wisconsin upset the heavily-favored Kentucky Wildcats, 71-64. Duke won with a final score of 81-61 over the Michigan State Spartans. The Duke Blue Devils then went on to win their fifth national title over the Wisconsin Badgers with a score of 68-63.

If Duke wasn't your final pick in your bracket, no worries, there’s always next year.
