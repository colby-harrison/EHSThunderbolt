Cheyenne East forward Caleb Pushcar had successful surgery to repair damage to his C6 and C7 vertebrae on Saturday in Salt Lake City.

There is even a good chance the senior could cross the stage at East’s graduation ceremony Saturday at Okie Blanchard Stadium.

Pushcar suffered the injury in a collision with Sheridan goalkeeper Jess Edens during East’s 3-1 semifinal win Friday. East forward Anthony Barnes chipped a high pass over a Sheridan defender and both Pushcar and Edens were watching the ball as it sailed into the penalty area at Rock Springs Junior High.

Both players jumped for the ball and Pushcar’s head hit Edens in the chest. Edens landed on Pushcar when they hit the turf and Pushcar had to be helped off the field. He walked out of the stadium under his own power but was holding an ice pack at the base of his neck.

Both East and Cheyenne Central players briefly huddled together at midfield in a gesture to honor Pushcar before Saturday’s state championship match.

A fund to help Pushcar’s family with medical expenses has been established at http://www.gofundme.com/a54e3c.

Update: It is reported that Caleb is up and walking and will return to Cheyenne on Monday, June 1.
