_Furious 7_, the next installment of the _Fast and Furious_ series, and the final movie of the late Paul Walker, finds the team of drivers coming together again to survive yet another challenge from yet another opponent. Serving up a familiar but fresh round of over-the-top thrills, while adding some unexpected drama, _Furious 7_ keeps the money-making franchise moving.

This time the team is being hunted by a special agent after the defeat of his brother in the previous movie. From thinking they are free after so many years of running from the police as well as other adversaries, but they get pulled back into the fray. The action-packed film was slightly overstretched with stunts that seem impossible for drivers of any caliber, but maintains enough realism to keep you from setting it aside as just purely a joke.

The film was not only just another sequel but also a send off for a lost actor. Paul Walker’s passing happened partway through the movie in an off-set car crash. The other actors spent months in interviews giving tributes and talking about their experiences with Paul. The movie was postponed, then taken off production completely. The plot was rethought and went back into production using four body doubles to fill Walker’s shoes. Paul's brothers, Cody and Caleb Walker, were brought in to help as stand-ins to finish the movie. Not only was the production finished, but a tribute to Paul Walker was added in a way that both helped the plot and gave Paul a respectable send off.

With the over exaggerated action scenes, witty one-liners, and the soap opera moments scattered throughout the movie, the seventh movie manages a successful production that will interest both past fans and new ones.
