The latest social media trend is leaving its mark on teenagers, in more ways than one. "Kylie Jenner lips" has exploded across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and is leaving teens with bruised faces and pride.

The reality star's lips, which are known for being supposedly perfect to teen girls and fans of the star- seem to be the new "it trend". Countless videos and pictures are circling the Internet under the hashtag #KylieJennerChallenge where those wanting her plump lips put a shot glass around their mouth and suck for a couple minutes before removing it. Though teens think this works for the perfect looking lips, it can be devastating with bruised faces and damaged mouths.

The challenge may  leave bruises around your lips in some case or, even worse, a run to the ER to get stitches. There are some cases where the shot glass breaks under the pressure and has caused cuts to the person's lips.

LCSD1 nurse Amber Edwards says the swelling and bruising is caused from blood vessels popping. While Edwards says it's not a good idea to try, she believes it will heal and should not leave permanent damage. However, in some cases, the shot glass has broken and caused injury. There is a risk of nerve damage. The bruising is usually temporary and should heal the way any other bruise would.

Even though permanent damage is unlikely, the embarrassment of facial bruising can last for weeks. The star spoke out against the recent trend on Twitter.

"I'm not here to try to encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look, I want to encourage people/young girls like me to be YOURSELF and not be afraid to experiment with your look," Jenner said in a recent tweet.

Is the challenge worth the bruises and cuts to achieve the perfect lips? It's all a matter of opinion, but the challenge isn't recommended unless you want a ring of bruises around your lips and an interesting story to explain to your family and friends- especially if you have to go to the ER for stitches.
