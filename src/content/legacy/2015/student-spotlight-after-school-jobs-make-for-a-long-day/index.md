Being a teenager is hard enough - school, sleep, studying, friends, family, fun. There's just so many hours in a week.

For a lucky few of us, all we have to worry about is school and some weekend fun (and maybe a little time to study). And then there's the Thunderbirds who find time to squeeze in some extracurricular activities and give us something to cheer for on Friday nights.

But for junior Julia Fischer, her days start at 7:45 AM and often end around 11:00 PM.  Julia moved to Cheyenne this past winter and decided, like many teens, she needed some extra cash. After looking around for different opportunities, she can now be found working behind the counter at Baskin Robbins. The world’s largest chain of ice cream specialty shops, according to their website, gives Julia the extra cash she hoped for, but she gives up a lot after school and on the weekends for her money.

_**Q&A**_

_Q: How was your switch from Wisconsin to Cheyenne?_

A: It was hard leaving all my friends and family, but I’m adjusting very well.

_Q: How do you keep up with work and school?_

A: The nights that I’m not working, I do my homework that is due for the next couple of days rather than having to do it the night before. That way I know it gets done, and I don’t have to worry about it.

_Q: What job did you have before you moved?_

A: I worked at a nursery in my church and at an orthodontist office.

_Q: How has working and keeping up with school affected other things in your life?_

A: It hasn't affected a lot, probably just my social life.

_Q: Has working and going to school been stressful?_

A: Yes, especially when I have a big project due and have little time to do it.

_Q: How have you dealt with the stress?_

A: I just take a deep breath and tell myself it’s going to get done one way or another, so I've got to do it and make time for it.
