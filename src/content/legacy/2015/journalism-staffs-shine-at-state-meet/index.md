State Championships aren't just for sports. The Wyoming High School Student Press Association's (WHSSPA) Wyoming High School Journalism Convention (WHSJC) is the state championship of high school newspaper and yearbook. The WHSJC provides yearbook and newspaper students with the opportunity to enter their work for the chance to win state titles and to attend workshops to strengthen their skills. The 2015-2016 _Thunderbolt_ and EHS yearbook staffs attended this year's WHSJC and even entered some of their work. The results were fantastic.

This year the _Thunderbolt_ staff took home several awards. The _Thunderbolt_ received the awards for All-State Online Newspaper and All-State Runner Up Print Paper. East High swept the photography awards, with photographers: Courtney Walston, Emilygrace Piel, and Mickayla Welsh taking first in four out of six categories. Current Thunderbolt Senior Editor Courtney Walston took home the All-State Photographer Award, while former Thunderbolt Senior Editor Emilygrace Piel took home the award for All-State Runner Up Photographer.

The 2015-2016 WHSJC was a great experience for the _Thunderbolt_ and EHS yearbook staffs.

"I learned that cohesiveness is a necessary part of being in a group and teamwork is a vital part of being able to produce a successful product," said senior Courtney Walston. "I was so excited when I heard my name called for All-State Photographer. It made my motivation for capturing emotions with a camera even stronger because I am absolutely determined to receive the same award next year."  

The students were given the information and tools they need to succeed in putting out a better publications each year.
