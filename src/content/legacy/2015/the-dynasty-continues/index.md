According to all-knowing Wikipedia, "a sports dynasty is a team that dominates their sport or league for an extraordinary length of time. The definition of dynasty by academics implies a single leader over the bulk of that period, a great example being John Wooden who led the college basketball powerhouse UCLA Bruins." Hello, Lady Thunderbird soccer!

The Thunderbirds soccer team won their third straight state title, 1-0, by holding off a determined Sheridan Lady Bronc team in Rock Springs at the state soccer tournament.  And they did it without their Gatorade Player of the Year, junior Abby Morillon, who watched from the sidelines after suffering a left knee injury in the semi-final.

Junior mid-fielder Karly Thompson thundered home the winning shot in the 59th minute from 35 yards out. The shot and resulting goal generated a storm of rave reviews on the Internet and nearly shut down Twitter-verse. Jeremiah Johnke, sportswriter for wyosports.org, tweeted, "Sheridan tried to clear the ball and it went right to Thompson, who likely deformed the ball with that shot."

In an interview with wyosports.org, Karly said, "“It was so quick and fast. I just hit it as hard as I could, like we do in practice. Thankfully it went in."

The Thunderbirds earned a trip to the championship game by beating Rock Springs 3-1 in overtime and then taking down a tough Laramie team, 2-1, in the semi-finals.

East beat Sheridan, 6-1, last year for the title game and Cheyenne Central, 2-1, in 2013 to begin the three-year run of championships.
