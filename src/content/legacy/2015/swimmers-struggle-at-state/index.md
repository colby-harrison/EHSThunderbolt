The East High Lady Thunderbird Swimming and Diving team prepared for the state swim meet all season long. The team traveled to Gillette for the tournament with nine qualifiers and five non-qualifiers to compete.

The T-Birds finished in seventh place with a total of 51 points. Senior Ryann Schoene had the best individual finish, placing ninth in the 200 medley, at 2:23.59, and seventh in the 100 breaststroke with a time of 1:12.39. Sophomore MacKenna Smith also scored well for the Lady T-Birds, taking tenth in the 500 freestyle.

“We did okay as a team,” said junior Suzi Keller. “We had a few make finals and a couple of personal records from a couple of our swimmers. We took 7th and I hope we can improve at state next year.”

Swimming is often viewed as an individual sport, but the team relies on each other to get better. With a young 2015 team, the future looks promising.

“I look forward to seeing how everyone improves next year,” said junior Suzi Keller. “I also look forward to bonding with my team more.”

Lady T-Birds that competed at State included: Bailey Rumpf, Brittny Dye, Ryann Schoene, Suzi Keller, Hannah Jankovsky, Mackenzie Hoskins, MacKenna Smith, Kelly Farris, Briley Phipps, Abby Byrd, Sarah Martin, Kendrew Ellis, Saige Smith and Brittney West.
