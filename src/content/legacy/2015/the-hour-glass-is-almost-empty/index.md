Even though graduation feels as if it’s not coming fast enough for the class of 2015, it’ll actually be here in just a few short months. As many seniors know, a large amount of preparation needs to be done to attend a college in the fall, and getting a bad case of pre-graduation laziness won’t help at all.

Senioritis can hit hard during these next few months, but one must not cave to temptation. Skipping out can hurt a reputation pretty badly.

“Do not get senioritis because colleges can refuse to take you even if you have already been accepted if you take a huge nose dive in your senior year, plus it just doesn’t look good,” says Ruth Keto, East High career advisor . Skipping out doesn’t look good, but neither does uncompleted applications. A very relatable motto: Better late than never!

College, scholarship and FAFSA applications can still be submitted but it should be completed as soon as possible.

“You’ll want to get a FAFSA submitted so you’ll have to have an application into the school so that they can send you a financial report so you know what’ll cost you to go to school” says Ms. Keto.

The Majority of the deadlines for colleges have passed but some in-state colleges such as University of Wyoming don’t really have an application due date for in-state students, though completing applications past January is pushing it pretty far. Ms. Keto is available in the career center for more information.

Scholarships can save college students thousands in college expenses, so why not take the opportunity to save money when getting a degree?

“You’ll want to apply for as many scholarships as you possibly can because money is good and your parents shouldn’t have to jeopardize their future for yours,” says Ms. Keto.

There’s a large number of scholarships available, so getting applications completed quickly is essential.

There are a number of specialized and unique scholarships as well. One of the most unique is a scholarship for the best tuxedo and/or prom dress made from duct tape. The grand prize winners from 2014 won $10,000 as a scholarship and $5,000 for the school they’re attending. If you believe your duct tape skills are unbeatable, search for “Stuck at Prom” to get in on this creative scholarship opportunity.

The Hathaway scholarship is another beneficial way of receiving money for a higher education based on levels of GPA and ACT score. Talk to the East High career center today.
