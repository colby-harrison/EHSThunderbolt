The Wyoming House Education Committee voted 6-3 on Friday, January 30, to the proposed House Bill 198 that, if put into law, would raise the high school dropout age and grade to 17 years of age and/or completion of grade 11.

In an interview with the Wyoming Tribune Eagle, Representative Steve Harshman (Casper) said that he was in support of the bill because it is a way to convince a higher number of students to stay in school and receive their diploma as well giving educators an extra year to help potential dropouts find alternative programs rather than letting the dropout rate increase.

“I just think a lot can happen in a year for a young person in how they grow and develop,” stated Harshman.

As well as Harshman, East High graduation coach Kimberly Rayl is in full support of the bill being put into law.

“I was really pleased when I saw that,” said Rayl. “When I took this job five years ago, I became aware that the legal age to leave school was 16 and so one of the things, as graduation coaches, we proposed right away was that we change that. We weren't necessarily involved in the bill but we have voiced our concern.”

While the state and school districts understand the need to encourage students to stay in school, high school students need to realize the consequences of their choices.

“I think a lot of times adolescences don’t see that the decisions they’re making, how much it’ll affect them in the years to come and as you get older it’s harder to go back and get your GED because it’s embarrassing that you didn't get it done when you should have,” said EHS senior Rachel Marston.

Now that the bill has passed the House Education Committee, it will move to the House floor for more debate and possibly advance to the state Senate.
