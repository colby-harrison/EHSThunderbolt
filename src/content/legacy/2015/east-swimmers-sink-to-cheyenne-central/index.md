The East High Lady Thunderbird swim team fell short to their cross town rival Cheyenne Central during the dual at East High Friday September 18. The Lady Thunderbirds had few individual wins. Sophomore McKenna Smith won the 100 butterfly. Junior Jessika Nelson diving won diving with a score of 158. Easts Ryann Schoene made a qualifying time in the 200 freestyle adding on another event to her qualifying list. Even though the Lady T-Birds suffered a loss, the team was pleased with their effort. The final score ended up 116-70.

“I think I did really good,” said sophomore Makenna Smith “I won the 100 fly and I got a really good 200 time. As a team we did really, really good. We were awesome. We never gave up.”

The Lady T-Birds travel this week, where they will compete, they will travel to Gillette for the triple duals September 25-26. They hope to add some new state qualifiers in the next few weeks.
