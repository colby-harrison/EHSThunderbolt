There’s nothing like the sound of battle in the morning, the rise and fall of kings or the magnificent sight of a fire-breathing dragon.

If you're not already a fan of the hit drama _Game of Thrones_, now is the time. Get on Hulu right now, so you can understand what your friends mean when they say “Winter is coming” or “Everyone dies.” For you fans who have fallen behind, you need to catch up.  And for you diehard fanatics, get comfy in your throne and sit back, because you know an intense season is coming.

_Game of Thrones_ is a fantasy drama television series, created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and is an adaptation of _A Song of Ice and Fire_, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels.

Here’s a general summary, according to the IMDb website, to give you an idea of the setting and what you non-fans (poor souls) have been missing: “Set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, the series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realm's noble families for control of the Iron Throne. As the series opens, additional threats emerge in the icy North and in the eastern continent of Essos.  Nine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.”

This show features all the characteristics of a classic fantasy drama: deception, dragons, death, politics, sex, tribulations of monarchy and power, and elegance.  Keep in mind, the intense graphics and situations may not be for everyone, and they are certainly not recommended for the weak-stomached. Shocking elements of graphic murder, torture, and death are all part of the weekly shows.

For all of you who’ve got _Game,_ get ready for the return of all the families preparing for a new war. This season, the popular show is beginning to detach itself from the book series and should make for some entertaining twists and turns.  Apparently, the first four episodes have been leaked, so this is a gift for fans, but bad news for HBO.  The fifth season of Game of Thrones is now airing on HBO.
