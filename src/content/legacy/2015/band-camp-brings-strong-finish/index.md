When people hear the terms "pre-season camp" or "summer practice," their minds tend to naturally jump to football, but the East High Marching Band takes their pre-season and camp just as seriously.

In order to be one of the best in the state, the band spends a lot of time, like the football team, practicing and preparing for their competitions and  performances. While not many think of band as a competitive sport, the competition and desire to be the best is just as important to the marchers. Although they don’t get the same recognition that a football team would, they put in just as much effort and passion. Being part of the best band in the state means marching in the early morning and practicing for hours on your own time.

"We had three days of eight hours (of practice) a day under our belts," said sophomore Zamboni Brown.

The band, like the football team, has won their fair share of competitions over the years. Though not thought to be a competitive area, the band has never feared going face-to-face with other schools in the state in competition.

Practicing and being the best isn't all that matters to the band. They also spend the pre-season working to develop the same close relationships you will find on any team. Band camp gives the band time to spend together up in Estes Park and to bond.

"The memories we make help to create a bond that’s unique to the band," said senior Ty Wedl.

Spending that time together helps the band with their timings and be a more cohesive unit.

The band recently took these hours of work and put them to the test at the state band festival. The East High band received a superior rating for their performance. The superior rating is the best possible rating a group can receive.

All the long hours of pre-season practice and coming together as a unit paid off for the marching band.
