CHEYENNE, WYO. –  Ms. Rebecca Valdez, East High social studies teacher and Laramie County Community College women’s soccer assistant coach, has been named the North Region Junior College Assistant Coach of Year by the National Soccer Coaches of American Association for her work with the Golden Eagles program.

Valdez has been with the LCCC women’s soccer program for 12 years. A Cheyenne native, she was a three-time all-state performer at East High School, winning three state titles. She helped accumulate a record of 59-1-1 during her high school career under Coach Jim Gardner, who now also serves as the head coach of LCCC women’s soccer and continues to coach East High girls soccer.

She has been with Gardner since the soccer program started at LCCC and helped compile a record of 171-50-21 for the Golden Eagles.

“I’ve been lucky to have such a great group of kids and the award reflects that,” Valdez said. “I’ve learned a lot from Jim throughout my coaching career, and his trust in providing me with more roles has allowed me to grow.”

“I’ve got a big place in my heart for Becky,” Gardner said. “She has all the attributes to be a successful coach with the support she provides, duties she follows through with, not to mention she’s an excellent teacher.”

Valdez was a four-year starter and a four-year all-conference performer at Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota. She graduated from NSU in 2002 as a Verizon/Adidas Region VII Scholar Athlete and an All-American Scholar Athlete nominee. She also has her NSCAA Advance National Coaching certificate.
