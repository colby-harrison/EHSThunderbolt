A blast from the past hit East High students with the _Back to the Future_ Turnabout dance, put on by the DECA club on Saturday, February 7. Many students attended the film-themed dance and shook off the stress of the week to enjoy a night full of fun and free of homework.

“It really was fun,” said sophomore Madi Overstreet. “I danced hard and I got really tired, but I thought it was pretty cool and my boyfriend dressed up as Marty McFly.

The dance itself may have been a smash hit with some students, but what about the inventive ways in which to ask someone?

“I had a poster that had a crossword that I wrote out _Will you go to turnabout with me?,”_ said Overstreet. “Then I wrote this little thing on the other side about Back to the Future like ‘Great Scott ‘and stuff like that to tie in with the theme.”

Though Turnabout is a time for girls to show more creative side with inviting someone to accompany them, just going with some friends can make it all the while.

“Turnabout was a lot of fun going with friends,” said senior Violette Bray. “Since it’s my last year of high school, it was fun to just hang out and have a good time.”

As a whole, the Back to the Future Turnabout dance was a very enjoyable night to have fun and forget stress.
