Three Thunderbird football players were recently named to the USA TODAY 2015 American Family Insurance ALL-USA Wyoming Football Team. In the article posted on-line, senior Quinn Happold, junior Braden Morris and junior Jacob Ross were recognized for their accomplishments on the football field.

All three also received 2015 all-state recognition from the Wyoming Coaches Association. Quinn was named to the 2015 WCA all-state team for a second year in a row. Senior Jack Danni was also a two-time WCA all-state selection.

East High football finished the 2015 season at 6 wins and 4 losses, losing in the semi-final round of the playoffs to Campbell County, the eventual 4A state runner-up.
