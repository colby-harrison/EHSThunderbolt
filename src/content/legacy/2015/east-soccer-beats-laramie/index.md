Junior Caleb Pushcar scored within the first three minutes of the game, with a little help from sophomore Quinn Hunt, to the lead the boys Thunderbird soccer team to a 2-1 victory against Laramie. The T-Birds squared off against the Plainsmen on Tuesday, May 12, at the UW North 40 fields, in Laramie.

Senior Gabe Cruz was also able to score a goal for the T-Birds with a little help from freshmen Brayden Parker. Senior goalkeeper Dalton Hass made seven saves in the game.

The Thunderbirds played one of their better halves of the season early in the game, taking a 2-0 lead into the locker room.

Laramie's lone goal came on a Blake Moore long free kick that was initially saved by Hass but bounced to one of the Plainsman's strikers, Andrew Barnes, who headed it in for the Plainsmen to bring them back to within one goal. The game ended with the Thunderbirds turning away relentless Laramie attacks.
