Rolling out of a successful weekend at Regionals, and wrapping up a season at 30-1, the varsity volleyball team powered their way through a schedule of few challenges. Now, the team hopes to finish things up and bring home a consecutive state championship. The Lady T-Birds head to Casper on Thursday, November 5, for the Class 4A State Volleyball Tournament.

Though the team has their spot saved for state, they can’t forget what they had to do to achieve the spot. The next few days before state, the girls will work harder than ever if they want to win against their toughest and biggest competition -  Gillette.

“Gillette will probably be our toughest competition because they have a really good coach, team, and players,” said junior Sydney Montoya. “They are also good at staying composed during matches.”

The Lady T-Birds may have posted a near-perfect season this year, but they couldn’t have done it without working hard.

“We have practice every day for at least two hours,” said junior Natasha Heins. “Some days it can last up to three hours when preparing for state.”

Hard work is a very important key for the girls at state but so is working as a team. One thing that stands out when you sit and watch this team is their relationships. They scream and cheer for each other on every point. They huddle and comfort each other after every missed shot. They truly are a team.

“We need to make sure we are working as a team and playing our best,” said junior Natasha Heins. “We need to remain composed even when it gets tough.”

East High is ranked No. 1 in the state and will first face the Green River Wolves at 1:00 on Thursday. If they win, they would face the winner of the Sheridan-Natrona game at 4:30 on Friday. The championship match is scheduled for Saturday at 4:00. All of the tournament games are played in the Casper Event Center.
