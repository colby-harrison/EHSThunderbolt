It's that time of the year again-time for East High's theater department to put on its annual school musical. The members of the East High theater department have been recognized for their ability to bring their audiences some of the most talented and entertaining shows at the high school level. The school musical has always been the biggest and most exciting show that this award winning theater department puts on and this year will be no exception.

This year's musical, _The Music Man,_ is set to hit the stage this spring. Ms. Christina Zarr, East High's theater teacher, will be directing the production.

_Th__e Music Man_ centers around con man Professor Harold Hill and his quest to convince the citizens of a small town in Iowa to buy into his idea of a band for the town's young men. Professor Hill is able to convince the townsfolk that without a band their boys will become thugs and thieves and uses their newfound passion for "saving" their children to trick them into investing in instruments and uniforms that he never plans to deliver. Along the way Professor Hill and the townsfolk engage in several well placed moments of romance and comedy as well as many lively musical numbers.

This year's show promises to wow audience with a full set and a large cast. Ms. Zarr is also planning on bringing in several middle and elementary aged students to act as small parts and extras in the show. With such a large amount of work going into the show, East's theater department has their work cut out for them. But with a state championship under their belts, the students are ready to work their hardest to make this musical great.

"It's going to be a big project to take on," said senior Dallas Kroeger, head lighting technician for the show. "I'm looking forward to the work."

Auditions for _The Music Man_ will be held on Monday, December 14, and Tuesday, December 15, from 3:00-5:00 after school. Those hoping for a part should try and make both audition dates and be ready to sing and dance in a group as part of their audition.
