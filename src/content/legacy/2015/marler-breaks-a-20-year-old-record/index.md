Freshman MacKenzie Marler displayed the result of her hard work and dedication in the SaberCat Invitational by knocking off the long-standing school record cross country time.

"I've put in a lot of hard work," said Marler. "We practiced every day, five days a week, so that helped out."

The record for the East high girls cross country girls 5k was set 20 years ago. On October 4, Marler broke that record with a time of 18 minutes and 8.9 seconds at Fossil Ridge High School in Ft. Collins, CO.

Marler started running back in junior high to stay in shape for soccer. Little did she know that in a couple of years she would hold a new record at East High. She now plans to keep breaking her own records as the season continues.

“I’m really happy I got the record. Now I want to keep getting my time down and breaking my own record,” said Marler, in an interview with www.wyosports.net.

With Marler being in the top 10 ranked freshman in the nation, there are going to be high expectations for her seasons to come.

"I just kept my calm the whole race." said Marler. "I'm excited to see what all I can do in this sport."

State came fast for Marler. On October 24, the 4A state cross country meet was held in Sheridan, Wyoming. Marler ran a 5k in 18 minutes and 36 seconds to take second place behind Central's Aubrey Frentheway. The girls placed 10th overall out of 11 teams.
