Although the Thunderbird swim team has historically been one of the top swim teams in the state they haven’t won a state title since 1975. This year the swim team looks to change that with a powerful group of seniors and strong up and coming group of underclassmen. Their 107-70 win over Green River made for a record-breaking night and an even better senior night. The team broke several records, including the 200 yard freestyle relay team of seniors Ben Wisdorf, Trevor Adrian, Hunter Marshall, and Robert Brown who won with the time of 1:32.11. The 400 free relay team of Ben Wisdorf, Nate Montgomery, Robert Brown, and Hunter Marshall East broke a 25 year-old record with the time of 3:23.92.

Their dual with Rocks Springs ended with a 92-91 Tigers win, even though they lost the EHS still had some good swims for the night. Ben Wisdorf won both the 50 in 22.87 and 100 yard freestyle in 51.07. Robert Brown won the 200 individual medley in 2:11.00, and came in second in the 100 free with the time of 51.94. The team also had two winning relays.  Ben Wisdorf, Robert Brown, Trevor Adrian, and Hunter Marshall won the 200 freestyle relay with a time of 1:35.81, while Ben Wisdorf and Robert Brown teamed with Hunter Marshall and Nate Montgomery to win the 400 free relay with a time of 3:29.57.
