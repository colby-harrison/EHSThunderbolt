The Thunderbird track team finished a tough 2015 track season with a handful of medals from the 2015 Wyoming 4A State Track Meet held at Harry Geldien Stadium in Casper.

Senior Michael Downey placed third in the 1600 meter run in 4:25.70, falling short of the school record and in the 3200 meter with a time of 9:45.98.

“I didn’t feel quite as good as last week (at regionals),” Downey said in an interview with wyosports.com. “It would’ve been nice to have somebody else out there in front, but no one else wanted to, so I tried to lead it the whole way.

“I wanted the school record (in the outdoor 1,600), but I’m walking away with some indoor records. It’s cool to see how far I’ve come in four years.”

The boys track team placed eighth with a score of 29.02 total points. Senior Jacob Bobenmoyer contributed all he could, holding the longest-throw mark for most of the final rounds, but he finished in third in the shot put with a throw of 47 feet 103/4 inches. He also had a throw of 144-02 in the discus.

No Lady Thunderbirds finished in the top three in the meet. The girls track team placed ninth with a score of 27 points.
