When two top-ranked teams square off, no one is surprised when things end up pretty even. That's the way is supposed to be.

The second-ranked Lady Thunderbird and the fourth-ranked Laramie Lady Plainsmen faced each other in a tight battle on Tuesday, May 12, and the game ended, after overtime, all tied up 1-1.

In a game with rare scoring chances, sophomore Katie Loken took a deep shot and blasted it into the top of the net in the 47th minute. Laramie, which had a 10-4 shots on goal advantage in the game, had six shots in the second half. It paid off in the 72nd minute with a score from freshman Courtney Hamilton.

Senior goal keeper Ashton Brodahl made nine saves throughout the game, which helped the game stay a close. “I was very nervous,” said Brodahl in an interview with wyosports.net, who made nine saves in the game. “(Laramie) did a good job of pressuring us."

The Lady T-Birds are currently ranked second in the state and look toward fighting for a regional title on Thursday, May 21, and Friday, May 22.
