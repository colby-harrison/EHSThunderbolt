Cheyenne East girls soccer team took over the Scottsbluff Bearcats on Saturday, April 25, and beat the home town 8-0. In the first half Junior Abby Morillon scored a hat trick. Sophomores Katie Loken and Jessie Erickson added two goals each and Morillon had a pair of assists, which had the Lady Thunderbirds winning their third game of the week. Senior Micayla Ross added a late goal. The Lady Thunderbirds host Central Indians at 6 p.m. Friday.

Maintaining possession of the ball couldn't help the Cheyenne East boys soccer team in 2-1 loss against Scottsbluff Bearcats on Saturday. Thunderbirds head coach Ryan Cameron believed his team maintained possession for two-thirds of the game, an improvement from Thursday's scoreless tie against Laramie. Senior Caleb Pushcar scored in the 9th minute, setting a loose ball off a corner kick from junior Joe Froelicher.

Because of Nebraska's rule mandating a winner, the game ended in a shootout. The Bearcats scored on all five chances, while the T-Birds only managed to put three shots in the net. The Thunderbirds will host Cheyenne Central at 4 p.m. Friday.
