The Cheyenne East golf teams hosted the Cheyenne Invite on Friday, April 10, at the Airport Golf Course. The boys' team placed fourth at with a final score of 325, while the girls’ placed fifth at 331, led by senior Peyton GrandPre's ninth place finish.

While the finishing scores weren't up to the Thunderbirds' expectations, a few things will change the next time around.

“The golf tournament was good, and the weather was really nice so that helped,” said Peyton. “We were missing our top three golfers in this tournament. Having them back now, we should be able to place top three in the upcoming tournaments.”

The Thunderbirds are next in action on April 17 in Rawlins,  in Douglas on April 24, and will finish up the month in Scottsbluff on April 27.
