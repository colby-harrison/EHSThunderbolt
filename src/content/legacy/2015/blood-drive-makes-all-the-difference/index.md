There are many reasons to host a blood drive. Whether it's community goodwill or sharing the gift of life, blood drives are essential to the health of many ill and injured people. East High School hosts three blood drives each year to do all they can to help with the needs of the community. On Tuesday, April 14, the EHS Key Club, in cooperation with United Blood Services, hosted the final blood drive of the year.

Key Club members and seniors Nate Dausman, Dene Standifer, and Annaleise Johansen were working at the front table, giving out paperwork to the donors.

“Today we’re hosting the blood drive. Key Club’s putting on the blood drive for the school, so it’s our job to make sure things get done, and we get enough blood to save some lives,” said Dausman.

Donating blood is not only significant to the club and those receiving the donations, but the donors too. Senior Brandi Hill donated one unit of blood.

“I donated because I like to help. I donated here, and I started going on a regular basis,” said Hill. “I liked knowing I’m helping people.”

The Key Club filled 48 spots, but ended up receiving 31 units of blood total.
