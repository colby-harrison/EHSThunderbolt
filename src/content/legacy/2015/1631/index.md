Hanging with good friends and listening to good music is a nice way to spend a warm, summer Friday night in Cheyenne.

The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle recently released its summer music lineup, right before the best season for outdoor fun. Friday’s on the Plaza are free concerts held at the Cheyenne Depot Plaza every Friday from June 5 through September 4 from 5:30-8:00 pm. These special events offer the perfect opportunity to get out of the house and engage in the community affairs, even during the lazy nights of summer. Fridays on the Plaza gives Cheyenne the opportunity to enjoy a variety of different types of music for free.

While chairs are provided, seating is a premium, so get there early. The City does ask visitors to leave their pets at home. Vendors offer plenty of food and drink, but don't hesitate to visit the cafes and coffee shops throughout downtown. Parking is available along 15th Street and in the parking garage on Lincolnway, one block west from the Depot Plaza.
