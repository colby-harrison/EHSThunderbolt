On a rainy and cold May Saturday outside the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, it'd be easy to assume no one is waiting outside for long to see a concert. Yet on May 9, around noon, there was already a line down the block full of flannel and skinny jean-clad teens waiting for All Time Low. It was five hours before the doors even open, and the crowd gathered quickly. Nearly all of the girls had crazy colors in their hair and dark eyeliner, and many were decked out in all the band merchandise they could fit into one outfit. Surrounding the crowd was a strong showing of local bands who played their songs and handed out sample CD's and promotion posters. The most dominate sounds were the friendly greetings of fellow fans and those making new friends with anyone next to them in line, including myself. I had never felt so at home.

Though it may vary by concert and genre of music, this is the typical scenario on the morning of any concert. It's an extremely exciting experience to be surrounded by people who love the same music as you, dress like you, and love the same things as you.

Once inside the venue, after spending five long hours in the pouring rain and 30 degree weather, everyone crowded together and the excitement oozed from every corner of the auditorium. It was so crowded that no one seemed to even have their feet on the ground. A low roar crept across through the venue as the crowd grew, and everyone was talking or singing lyrics to their favorite All Time Low songs.

The opening bands took the stage and gave the first-time listeners a chance to fall in love with their music.  However, the biggest rush came when the lights dimmed low and one unified echo began to course across the upturned faces. The fun was just beginning.

When All Time Low began to play, the feeling in my stomach could be only described as intense butterflies. Their music has the power to get me through near anything. This band provides so much love to their fans, and the fact that they were under the same roof as me tightened my stomach to the point I could barely talk. The entire crowd buzzed. As I looked around at the many hands in the air and smiling faces, I realized that this band had the power to bring all of these people together in a complete state of happiness. After the first few chords of their guitars, I was completely lost in the music, with no sense of everyone else around me.

All Time Low has recorded dozens of songs over their 10-year run as a pop-punk band, and it was safe to say I didn't care what songs they played - I love them all. When front man Alex Gaskarth started strumming the chords to "Weightless," I was undeniably giddy. The lyrics are nearly engraved in my head, and I must admit I danced and sang harder than I ever have. When I looked around, I wasn't alone. Hundreds of hands reached high into the air, voices rang out in harmony, and the whole crowd  began to jump. This brought huge grins from the band on stage, considering the song is six years old.

"You guys sound great!" was all the band could keep saying throughout the show.

They slowed it down with "Missing You" and "Therapy," which provided an intimate experience with Gaskarth. You could almost hear a pin drop while he was singing "Missing You," and the silence was unbelievable. The only sounds were the screams when Gaskarth commented, "These songs are to anyone who's going through a rough time right now. Just know that it will get better and you will come out stronger for it and better for it." This reassurance seemed to be what everyone needed to hear from their favorite band.

I did miss the fast-paced, heavy instrumental songs though, which picked up quickly after the little acoustic session. It was safe to say I was extremely sad when Alex said, "This is gonna be our last song of the night guys. We gotta go."

As I was leaving the Fillmore, I felt so alive. I could feel my adrenaline pumping, my heart was racing and it was difficult to hide the smile on my face. I unfortunately was forced to part with my new-found friends that I spent the day bonding with over our love for the band's music. It was a bittersweet feeling leaving the concert because you felt like you could have listened to them play live forever. But you're also so happy that you got to see a band you love play live right in front of you in the first place.

The worst part of the evening was waking up the next morning with my makeup streaked across my face and a rat's nest where my perfectly-done hair used to be and thinking back to not even 12 hours before and wanting to relive every moment.

It's safe to say All Time Low rocked the Fillmore, along with their amazing opening acts - State Champs, Tonight Alive and Issues. When All Time Low comes to Colorado again, I'll be sure to be first in line to do it all over again.
