The East High yearbook staff is excited to announce the arrival of the 2019-2020 yearbook! This year’s theme – Embrace the Legacy – may have never been more appropriate than now. Obviously, with the radical changes in school this year, you don’t want to miss out on this one! The staff waited until the very last minute to submit their final deadline, so they could even include some COVID-19 coverage.

Our yearbook publisher, Jostens Inc, provided us with a limited number of extra yearbooks to sell on a first come, first served basis, and you can reserve a copy at www.jostensyearbooks.com until May 18. The cost is $75. These copies are limited and will only be available while supplies last.

East High asks you use the on-line ordering process to minimize contact and help maintain social distancing guidelines. There will be staff on-hand accepting cash or check payments, if necessary. Distribution will begin on May 20, and continue May 21, May 27 and May 28, from 8:00 am – Noon.

he books will be available at the west doors of the school, in the teacher parking lot. Please remain in your vehicle and the book will be delivered to your car. Please bring your student ID.

Questions should be sent to Mr. Dan Morris at Daniel.morris@laramie1.org.

UPDATE - MAY 7, 2020 - WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY BOOKS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DISTRIBUTION. AS OF MAY 7, WE HAVE 28 BOOKS REMAINING TO SELL, AND WE EXPECT THOSE TO BE SOLD WITHIN THE NEXT THREE DAYS. IF YOU WANT A BOOK, GO TO WWW.JOSTENSYEARBOOKS.COM AND ORDER NOW! AGAIN, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY BOOKS FOR SALE AT DISTRIBUTION!
