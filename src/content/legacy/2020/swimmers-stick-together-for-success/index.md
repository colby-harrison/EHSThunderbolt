Swimming can be difficult and lonely sport, so the best teams know winning starts with attitude and taking care of each other. Over the summer, the girls swim team came together as one. They spent their time practicing and bonding with team activities.

Once the swimming season started, they got together and came up with ideas they could use to make the team bond stronger. One of the strongest and most powerful, agreements was a commitment to not shave until state. Before every meet they give a motivational gift to their “secret sister” for them to feel confident for their big day.

“The season is going amazing because I have cut my time on my 50 and 200 free. Im trying to qualify for state to have my freestyle time at 29.4” said Freshman Madison Steen.
