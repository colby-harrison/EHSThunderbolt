East High School takes pride in calling itself “The School of Excellence,” and nothing proves that excellence more than the students. Three of East’s best were named LCSD1 Students of The Week for the 2019-2020 school year.

Raven Derr Lee is a hard-working, respectful student who is well-liked by his teachers. According to the Student of the Week nominating committee, Lee has overcome many challenges and always looks toward the future with a positive outlook of how he can make a difference in the world.

“In addition to strong academics and ROTC leadership, Raven has become a skilled athlete in our cross country and indoor/outdoor track program,” East High guidance counselor Angela Schelhaas said n a statement. “He continually pushes himself to grow his skills and demonstrates grit and perseverance daily.”

Melvin (Trey) D. Turner III, is a senior who is described as a student leader, advocates for himself and others, and a well-rounded student. He is a member of East High’s orchestra, where he plays a bass. Turner is also a leader in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and is a member of East High’s swim team, as well as a commander in EHS’s JROTC.

East High Spirit Office counselor Barb Wolfe said in a statement that, “Trey is a kind young man who greets people with a smile. He is also a humble person and always gives his parents credit for the quality of his character.”

The final honoree is YuYu Yuan, a junior. She attended Goins and Bain elementary schools, followed by Johnson Junior High, before enrolling in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program at East High School. She has excelled at Speech and Debate, placing in every tournament this year, and earning a State Championship in Oratory and reaching the State semi-finals in Public Forum.

East High speech and debate coach, Matt Prevedel, who also has Yuan in his IB literature class, said, “YuYu is one of the best orators and debaters in the state, in addition to being one of the best students I have ever taught.”

The East High School staff and student body could not be prouder of these students and take great pride in their awards.
