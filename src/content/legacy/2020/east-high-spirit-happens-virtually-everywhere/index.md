With most schools and districts shut down for the foreseeable future, many schools struggled to find ways to connect with their students. One idea that popped into a few teachers' minds was the concept of a virtual theme week.

Theme weeks are an easy and fun way to build school spirit â€¦ and there was no reason to stop doing so just because the classrooms have been shifted to distance learning. The theme days were posted ahead of time on social media and word quickly spread. Students, parents, family and friends were encouraged to post images or videos and use the hashtag #tbirdstrong.

East High's virtual spirit themes were: Favorite Jersey Day, Pajama Day, Super Hero Day, Crazy Hair Day, and T-Bird Fanatic Day.
