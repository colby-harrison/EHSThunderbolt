Cross Country is a sport full of running on open surface courses on dirt and grass. They all stick together as a team through the season motivating each other to the finish line. The runners are called Harriers they are individuals that take on other individuals from other schools.

The running course is measured to a 5000 meters (3.1 meters). No matter what the weather is they always try and finish the race with a positive attitude.

“Every meet I push myself more and more so I can make it to state. I love having the team I have because they push me and just be there to support me” said junior, Hunter Onistio.
