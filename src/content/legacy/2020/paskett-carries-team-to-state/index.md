Tennis is a sport not many people know if they will enjoy it because it takes a lot of skill and patience. It's easy to just give up when you aren't getting the hang of it, but eventually practice makes it easier as you put all your time and effort into getting better.

They started the season on a rough start with a 0-5 lost against Torrington, South, and Kelly Walsh. With learning new skills and practicing extra hard the team takes a victory beating South 4-1.

“My record going into regionals was 6-1. It was an improvement from previous years. I lost against South during the regular season, which had me very skeptical playing him again in the finals. I knew my strengths and weaknesses along with this to help me win the Regional Championship. I lost to Kelly Walsh, but I know what to do to win, so hopefully I'll play them in the state tournament as well,” said Senior Mason Paskett.
